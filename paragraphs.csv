0,This document includes an updated Part B Methodology from the June 2019 report and an updated Part F Full list of technical screening criteria The other original sections from the June 2019 report can be found as labelled in the June 2019 report
1,PART A Explanation of the Taxonomy approach This section sets out the role and importance of sustainable finance in Europe from a policy and investment perspective the rationale for the development of an EU Taxonomy the daft regulation and the mandate of the TEG
2,PART B Methodology This explains the methodologies for developing technical screening criteria for climate change mitigation objectives adaptation objectives and do no significant harm to other environmental objectives in the legislative proposal This has been updated since 2019
3,This report represents the overall view of the members of the Technical Expert Group and although it represents such a consensus it may not necessarily on all details represent the individual views of member institutions or experts The views reflected in this Report are the views of the experts only This report does not reflect the views of the European Commission or its services
4,In the June 2019 report the TEG explained the process used to assess and select economic activities for inclusion in the Taxonomy Shown in Figure 1 The Taxonomy Regulation has not materially changed the TEGs thinking on methodology for selecting sectors Further the TR takes up the TEGs recommended approach to identify enabling activities as a type of activity
5,The TEG also recognises that some important activities are not captured by the NACE codes For example urban and regional planning for low carbon development including avoided journeys support for lower carbon personal choices such as vegetarian diets and investments to maintain public natural capital such as natural forests and wetlands Further work is needed to include these in the Taxonomy in future
6,The first group of sectors included by the TEG were those with high climate change mitigation need and potential on the basis of scope 1 emissions data2 In addition the TEG considered aspects of B  Mining and Quarrying to the extent these supported activities in C  Manufacturing However a full evaluation of the mining and quarrying sector was not undertaken
7,TEG initially used Eurostat emissions inventory data from 2016 More recent emissions data is now available however this does not change the findings of the TEG as the sector profile of Europes emissions was broadly the same in 2016 and 2018
8,In addition the TEG recognised that failure to address the carbon performance of buildings which alone contribute 36 of CO2e emissions in the EU283 would risk causing harm to climate objectives Buildings are not a single economic activity under the NACE system The TEGs buildings criteria are designed to be crosscutting and apply across the economy with the exception of explicitly excluded sectors dedicated storage of fossil fuels For presentation purposes the TEG has aligned the building criteria with NACE codes for construction and real estate activities However the buildings criteria are not limited to these NACE codes and can be applied across other sectors and economic activities
9,The TEG also considered sectors that could enable a substantial contribution in one of the other selected sectors J  Information and Communication and M  Professional Scientific Technical activities and due to their potential to be enabling activities See Table X for a description of enabling activities
10,The selected macrosectors represent a minimum of 935 of NACEbased scope 1 emissions in the EU based on 2018 data although this figure is likely to be an underestimate as it does not consider buildings emissions in all sectors
11,2 TEGs analysis is based on Scope 1 emissions data as Scope 2 and 3 data by NACE code was not available However the Taxonomy recognises energy efficiency improvements consistent with the requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation
12,3 See httpseceuropaeuenergyentopicsenergyefficiencybuildings Note that emissions from buildings are considered across NACE codes Emissions from domestic buildings are typically excluded from NACE codes as domestic occupation is not considered an economic activity Nonetheless activities to reduce emissions from the residential sector should be considered in the Taxonomy
13,Where economic activities have the potential to enable substantial GHG emissions reductions in other sectors these should also be included assuming the life cycle emissions of the activity do not undermine mitigation objectives
14,The TEG has identified priority activities within each sector The name of each macrosector is drawn directly from the NACE classification system and may refer to activities that were not covered eg the TEG has developed technical screening criteria for agriculture and forestry but not fishing
15,This sector was selected because of its emissions profile The TEG has identified some important economic activities likely to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in this sector but further analysis should be undertaken
16,This sector was selected because it may be able to enable substantive emissions reductions in other sectors The TEG has identified the main economic activities likely to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in this sector
17,This sector was selected because it may be able to enable substantive emissions reductions in other sectors The TEG has identified some important economic activities likely to substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in this sector but further analysis should be undertaken
18,4 For presentation purposes the TEG has aligned the building criteria with NACE codes for construction and real estate activities However the buildings criteria are not limited to these NACE codes and can be applied across other sectors and economic activities
19,5 TEGs methodology was based on Scope 1 emissions but we recognise that Information and Communication activities may also have substantial Scope 2 emissions This is reflected in the technical screening criteria for Information and Communications
20,contribution andor avoidance of significant harm to the environmental objective in question b Criteria including both metrics and thresholds The methods by which the environmental performance of the economic activity will be measured including defining the boundary for this measurement and the qualitative or quantitative conditions which must be met to enable the performance of the activity in a way that is considered environmentally sustainable
21,1 An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation where that activity substantially contributes to the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level which prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system by avoiding or reducing greenhouse gas emissions or enhancing greenhouse gas removals through any of the following means including through process or product innovation consistent with the long term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement
22,a generating transmitting storing distributing or using renewable energy in line with Directive EU 20182001 including through using innovative technology with a potential for significant future savings or through necessary reinforcement or extension of the grid
23,fa strengthening land carbon sinks including through avoided deforestation and forest degradation restoration of forests sustainable management and restoration of croplands grasslands and wetlands afforestation and regenerative agriculture
24,1a For the purposes of paragraph 1 an economic activity for which there is no technologically and economically feasible low carbon alternative shall be considered to contribute substantially to climate change mitigation as it supports the transition to a climateneutral economy consistent with a pathway to limit the temperature increase to 15 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels including by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions in particular from solid fossil fuels where that activity
25,has greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry  does not hamper the development and deployment of lowcarbon alternatives and  does not lead to a lockin in carbonintensive assets considering the economic lifetime of those assets
26,In addition the EU has brought forward a proposal for a Climate Law requiring a climate neutral economy by 2050 as well as proposals for interim GHG emissions reductions targets of 50  55 by 2030 TEGs recommendations are aligned with these goals
27,The following table has been updated since the June 2019 report to show how to consider different types of investment and finance as Taxonomy eligible The update is to more clearly align with the Taxonomy Regulation which clearly identifies enabling activities reflecting the TEG recommendation We now refer to the two activity types as either An activity which has a substantial contribution due to its own performance  referring to the operations within the activity reflecting the activity boundary for the technical screening criteria or an Activity Enabling Mitigation in another economic activity
28,This table also demonstrates how activities that contribute to transition Transition Activities in the Taxonomy Regulation are still expected to substantially contribute to climate mitigation objectives and meet Taxonomy thresholds This was identified as the third activity type in the June 2019 TEG report
29,On this basis the TEG recommends that the Platform on Sustainable Finance prioritise full evaluation of existing sectors selected rather than the immediate expansion of the sectors covered However the Platform on Sustainable Finance should continue to monitor sectoral emissions in case of material changes in the underlying data
30,The TEG also recognises that some important activities are not captured by the NACE codes For example urban and regional planning for low carbon development including avoided journeys support for lower carbon personal choices such as vegetarian diets and investments to maintain public natural capital such as natural forests and wetlands Further work is needed to include these in the Taxonomy in future
31,The activities identified by the TEG using this methodology reflect the majority  but not all  of the economic activities which can avoid significant harm or substantially contribute to climate change mitigation In some cases the TEG was not able to fully evaluate the potential contribution of a subsector with the resources available in the timeframe available The TEG therefore recommends that the Platform on Sustainable Finance undertake further evaluation of activities within the existing sectors with a particular focus on
32,TEG also recommends that the Platform on Sustainable Finance continues the work on inclusion of enabling activities within other sectors in the Taxonomy Recognition of enabling activities is an important way to encourage research development innovation and resulting substantial GHG reductions in economic activities and encourage flows of finance to these activities
33,The methodology for identifying activities that provide a substantial contribution to adaptation has not changed since the publication of the taxonomy report in June 2019 The substantial contribution criteria for adaptation have not changed in nature but have been made consistent with the final regulation proposals of December 2019
34,The proposed approach for an adaptation taxonomy recognises that adaptation is context and location specific and requires the use of a processbased approach to determine if an activity contributes to adaptation and broader systems climate resilience The following twostep process aims to demonstrate that an activity contributes to a substantial reduction of the negative effects of climate change
35,a Assessing the expected negative physical effects of climate change on the underlying economic activity that is the focus of resiliencebuilding efforts drawing on robust evidence and leveraging appropriate climate information
36,The assessment of the contribution of the activity will vary based on its scope asset corporate sector or market as well as spatial and temporal scale Moreover the proposed approach recognises that an adaptation activity may target an entity eg a corporation or a city andor a market sector or region
37,Activitylevel adaptation aims at strengthening an asset or economic activity to withstand identified physical climate risks over its lifetime such as considering sealevel rise in the design of a bridge Systemic adaptation aims to actively reduce vulnerability and build resilience of a wider system or systems such as a community ecosystem or city
38,The TEG recognises that climate change will affect all sectors of an economy and all sectors must adapt to its impacts globally As a result the adaptation taxonomy is a set of guiding principles and qualitative screening criteria which can be applied in any economic activity in any location It is therefore the view of the TEG that these criteria are globally relevant
39,The contextspecific nature of adaptation means that it is not possible to produce a standalone and exhaustive list of activities that could be viewed as contributing to adaptation under all circumstances Instead of a list of adaptation activities a set of guiding principles and screening criteria is used to assess the potential contribution of an economic activity to adapt to climate change and increase climate resilience To aid users of the Taxonomy the TEG has also developed an indicative framework for classification of climaterelated hazards and a climate sensitivity matrix for specific economic activities see Classification of climaterelated hazards and Sectoral climate sensitivity matrices
40,There are fundamental differences between climate change adaptation activities and mitigation activities For mitigation activities a onetonne reduction of CO2 emissions has the same impact regardless of where the mitigation activity takes place It is therefore possible to define lists of activities that are
41,deemed to support climate change mitigation Adaptation responds to physical climate risks that are mostly location and context specific For example there are in principle several engineering and non engineering options available to a coastal city to respond to the risk resulting from increased sea level Responses will vary according to where the city is located its size the institutional and financial capacity of the city administration to deal with climate risk the technical and engineering expertise available the priority of the city the perception of the citizens and other factors The adaptation responses will benefit the city that adopts them and possibly the systems that depend or interact with the city
42,The proposed approach is based on qualitative screening to identify activities that contribute to adaptation Qualitative screening criteria allow for a structured processbased approach to determine if an economic activity contributes to adaptation As measured baselines or accepted metrics for adaptation have not yet been developed an established methodology for defining quantitative screening criteria for adaptation and defined adaptation targets at the national sectoral or subnational level do not exist Even with the availability of methodologies targets or baselines quantitative screening criteria could exclude smallscale activities that may deliver significant climateresilience benefits in specific contexts
43,The Adaptation Taxonomy covers 68 economic activities which were originally selected for their potential to deliver a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation The application of the adaptation taxonomy beyond these activities is only constrained by the lack of availability of DNSH criteria for the other five environmental objectives covered by the Taxonomy
44,A number of economic activities that might be important for climate adaptation are not yet included in the economic activities currently addressed in the Taxonomy The application of the taxonomy will be expanded to more economic activities as criteria for DNSH to other environmental objectives are developed
45,In that respect the TEG recommends that the economic activities listed in the table below be prioritised for further work on DNSH criteria to the other environmental objectives because of their high potential for a substantial contribution to adaptation
46,The TEG gave close consideration to the inclusion of two of these economic activities into the Taxonomy for this report namely research  development and Telecommunications computer programming and information The TEGs analysis on these issues can be found in the section titled Additional adaptation activities for further consideration However on due reflection the view was taken that further consideration of the DNSH criteria for these activities would be needed before this could be done
47,The TEG also recommends that the platform review the proposed DNSH criteria for NonLife Insurance 6512 and Engineering Activities and Related Technical Consultancy Dedicated to Adaptation to Climate Change 7112 as a matter of priority These criteria are conservative in that they recognise service provision only to activities themselves eligible under the Taxonomy It may be preferable to simplify the criteria to increase coverage and enhance usability
48,The proposed regulation establishes a framework for understanding substantial contributions to climate change adaptation objectives This definition is broadly consistent with that provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change9
49,9 The IPCC provides the following definition of adaptation in their 5th Assessment Report The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects In human systems adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities In some natural systems human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects IPCC 2014 Climate Change 2014 Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability Part B Regional Aspects Contribution of Working Group II to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Barros VR CB Field DJ Dokken MD Mastrandrea KJ Mach TE Bilir M Chatterjee KL Ebi YO Estrada RC Genova B Girma ES Kissel AN Levy S MacCracken PR Mastrandrea and LL White eds Cambridge University Press Cambridge UK and New York NY USA
50,that economic activity includes adaptation solutions that either substantially reduce the risk of adverse impact or substantially reduces the adverse impact of the current and expected future climate on that economic activity itself without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on other people nature and assets or where that economic activity provides adaptation solutions that in addition to the conditions laid down in Article 11a contribute substantially to preventing or reducing the risk of adverse impact or substantially reduces the adverse impact of the current and expected future climate on other people nature or assets without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on other people nature and assets
51,The adverse impact of climate change considered for the development of the taxonomy include impact resulting from both chronic or slow onset climaterelated hazards such as average temperature increase and sea level rise and rapid or acute climate related hazards such as extreme rainfall storm surges flooding and heat waves
52,In this report material physical climate risk is the risk of financial and nonfinancial losses occurring due to performance failures performance delays or incomplete performance of an economic activity resulting from climaterelated hazards
53,Both types of activities must also meet the criteria for Do No Significant Harm to other environmental objectives and comply with minimum social safeguards established for the Taxonomy Activities adapted to climate change and activities enabling adaptation of other economic activities provide a positive environmental impact by meeting a set of technical criteria for substantial contribution to adaptation and a
54,set of criteria for doing no harm to other environmental objectives whilst avoiding adverse impacts to people asset and nature and preventing a lockin in activities that undermine longterm environmental goals
55,This is consistent with the approach taken when identifying economic activities that substantially contribute to climate change mitigation in terms of mitigated activity and activity enabling mitigation
56,The first set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via adopting solutions that ensure that the economic activity can perform well under a changing climate This contribution to adaptation usually occurs in economic activities that have a primary objective other than climate change adaptation For example a transmission line for the distribution of electricity to an urban area is made more climate resilient to the expected increase in temperature by installing conductors with operating limits at higher temperature thresholds Efforts to identify and reduce physical climate risks to an economic activity should be based on a best effort basis recognising that it is not possible to reduce physical climate risk to zero The characteristics of risks to an economic activity are increasingly difficult to predict over long time horizons because of the uncertainties associated with future changes in the climate As a result adaptation of an economic activity requires a proportionate flexible and an iterative risk management approach that can be adjusted over time
57,The second set of economic activities contribute to adaptation via enabling the adaptation of other economic activities For example the construction of a flood protection system is performed to reduce the risk of flood for a facility or a city and the economic activities that take place in it Similarly the research
58,Solutions that support adapted activities and economic activities enabling adaptation are clearly linked and may overlap However the distinction between these two types of adaptation activities can guide different user types Adapting an economic activity captures the solutions required by actors to increase their own resilience whilst enabling activities capture the research development marketing and installation of solutions that will help other entities to adapt For example a water utility vulnerable to increased risk of floods may adopt early warning systems to reduce this risk and this would count as part of the programme of solutions that entity is taking to ensure their activity is adapted to climate change ie part of their response to adapting that economic activity However a small or mediumsized enterprise SME developing the technology for flood early warning systems to support adaptation of other sectors including by the water utility company This activity of the technology developer is therefore counted as enabling adaptation This example is illustrated in Figure 8 below
59,Some of the economic activities currently addressed in the Taxonomy might often fall under the category of adapted activities others might be activities enabling adaptation There will be activities that can be either type depending on their purpose and the context within which the activity takes place What is key is the primary objective of the actor engaged in that activity For this reason the economic activities are not a priori categorised into Adapted activity andor Activity enabling adaptation this is left to the discretion of the user
60,For example Conservation Forestry could be deemed to be an activity enabling adaptation if the primary objective of the conservation activity is to support the adaptation of other economic activities or actors eg to prevent soil erosion damaging agricultural production or threatening local settlements or water supplies Conversely Conservation Forestry where the primary purpose is to promote biodiversity may be treated as an adapted activity if they are at the same time ensuring that those forests are resilient to climate change risks This is a difficult line to drawn given the interrelationships and cobenefits between these objectives In such cases users are asked to identify and justify whether their activity should be viewed as an adapted activity or an activity enabling adaptation of other economic activities and meet the appropriate criteria accordingly
61,Alternatively construction of a new building NACE code F41 or F43 could be deemed to be an activity enabling adaptation if the building is specifically purposed for adaptation and resilience eg shelters or safe buildings for evacuation from floodingtyphoons This is not unusual in countries like Bangladesh and the Philippines though not common practice in Europe But where not specifically purposed construction of a new building would only make a substantial contribution to adaptation via becoming an adapted activity
62,In the case of an adapted economic activity the activity integrates measures aimed at reducing all material physical climate risks to that activity as identified through an assessment of risks posed by both current weather variability and expected future climate change The assessment should take into account chronic and acute climaterelated hazards and associated physical climate risks across a range of scenarios and account for uncertainty It should consider geographic and temporal scales that are appropriate for the economic activity
63,In the case of an economic activity enabling adaptation the activity reduces material risks to other economic activities andor addresses systemic barriers to adaptation for example through a dedicated asset technology service or product and itself integrates measures aimed at reducing material risks where applicable eg in the case of a dedicated asset
64,activities should be consistent with adaptation needs in the applicable sector or region considering opportunities to build resilience outside of the premises of a single activity Those measures should also not increase the risk of an adverse impact on other people nature and assets in terms of hindering adaptation efforts by others for example by shifting impacts faced by others
65,defined indicators for adaptation results If possible updated assessments of physical climate risks should be undertaken at the appropriate frequency eg every five or ten years depending on the risks the context and the availability of new information technologies or approaches or policies and regulations
66,While the principles describe the foundations and qualities underpinning economic activities that contribute to climate change adaptation the screening criteria are specific characteristics that can be used to determine whether an economic activity provides a substantial contribution to adaptation These screening criteria vary between adapted activities and activities that enable adaptation These criteria have been updated since the June 2019 report
67,A11 The economic activity integrates physical and nonphysical measures aimed at reducing  to the extent possible and on a best effort basis  all material physical climate risks to that activity which have been identified through a risk assessment
68,The economic activity reduces material physical climate risk in other economic activities andor addresses systemic barriers to adaptation Activities enabling adaptation include but are not limited to activities that
69,The TEG recommends that the Platform as a matter of priority develops technical guidance on climate risk assessment use of climate data and information making decisions under uncertainties and evaluation of different adaptation options to aid the implementation of the taxonomy
70,In the case of an adapted economic activity at this time only the costs of adaptation can be counted not the revenues and or expenditure associated with the whole activity This is because adaptation of an economic activity is delivered in activities that have primary objectives other than adaptation for example adaptation of an electricity transmission line to increased risk of flood When those activities are adapted to cope with physical climate risk they contribute to the climate resilience of the entire highly integrated and interconnected economic system and as a result deliver a global benefit through aggregated adaptation in all sectors of an economy However methodologies tools and metrics to measure these climate resilience benefits remain under development These technical limitations mean that counting only the costs of adaptation of the economic activity is the most viable conservative option today
71,In some circumstances investments required to adapt an economy activity may be large and implemented in phases as part of an adaptation plan which has been developed in response to a climate risk assessment In these circumstances investments in measures included in a full programme of actions that collectively reduce the material physical climate risks to the economic activity can be counted in phases even if the whole adaptation plan has not been executed It is expected that the full programme of measures would be executed over a period of time no longer than 5 years
72,It is proposed that as a matter of priority the Platform undertake further work to develop approaches for measuring the climate resilience benefits of adapted economic activities This is a key step in moving towards recognising all revenue andor expenditure associated with an economic activity that is adapted to cope with physical climate risk and yields high climate resilience benefits
73,The TEG has developed a classification of climaterelated hazards When developing the Taxonomy the climaterelated hazards considered are limited to the potential occurrence of a weather and climate related natural physical event or trend12
74,The climaterelated hazard classification comprises four major hazard groups with hazards related to water temperature wind and massmovements All groups include acute extreme and chronic slow onset hazards as adaptation must account for both rapid as well as gradual changes in the weather and climate to take the appropriate adaptation measures and avoid maladaptation13
75,All secondary hazards14 resulting from climaterelated hazards including but not limited to chemical biological ecological and epidemiological hazards are excluded It is however advisable to assess the risk of such secondary hazards and consider measures to address them for each economic activity
76,12 IPCC 2014 Climate Change 2014 Synthesis Report Contribution of Working Groups I II and III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Core Writing Team RK Pachauri and LA Meyer eds IPCC Geneva Switzerland 151 pp httpswwwipccchsiteassetsuploads201802SYR_AR5_FINAL_fullpdf last visit 02042019
77,13 There are clearly linkages with disaster risk reduction in the effort of reducing physical climate risks resulting from extreme climaterelated hazards Geophysical and technological hazards are outside the domain of adaptation to climate change
78,14 As an example new biological pests or increased prevalence of existing pests can result from changing temperatures Forests and agriculture are typically sensitive to warmer minimum temperatures and in this example their effects on pests In this case the changing prevalence of pests is a secondary hazard against which adaptation measures may be needed
79,Under the proposed Taxonomy regulation economic activities making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation or adaptation must be assessed to ensure they do not cause significant harm to all remaining environmental objectives An activity contributing to climate change mitigation must avoid significant harm to climate change adaptation and the other four environmental objectives
80,This assessment ensures that progress against some objectives are not made at the expense of others and recognises the reinforcing relationships between different environmental objectives In its future development the Taxonomy will also include activities that make a substantial contribution to the above objectives
81,Per Article 12 of the Taxonomy regulation an economic activity shall be considered as significantly harming climate change adaptation where that activity leads to an increased adverse impact of the current and expected climate on itself or for other people nature and assets
82,In terms of what constitutes or leads to an increased negative effect of climate by an economic activity for and beyond the environment within which that economy activity takes place it is proposed that the DNSH to adaptation criteria should ensure that both
83,be resilient to climate change If they are not and those services are significantly curtailed due to climate change impacts the resilience and ability to adapt of those activities populations ecosystems is weakened This can be achieved by ensuring that all material risks to the economic activity itself have been reduced to the extent possible and on a best effort basis
84,Discussion was had on whether compliance with these requirements should be determined on a caseby case basis through an activity and context specific assessment or whether an apriori activity only level assessment is needed As discussed above adaptation needs and impacts of activities on adaptation and resilience are context specific and therefore a context specific assessment is needed
85,For these reasons the two criteria described in Table 6 are proposed for DNSH to adaptation for all economic activities In addition to these criteria the TEG has considered where there are any examples of tools methodology or other guidance that might be of use in applying these two criteria in the context of a specific economic activity Where such examples have been identified they have been noted in the DNSH to Adaptation section of the appropriate economic activity
86,It is noted that for new economic activities the following criteria must be met at the point of design and construction For existing activities and associated assets where addressing physical climate risks requires a retrofit of some kind all material physical climate risks must be assessed and adaptation measures required to address them must be identified and programmed with a clear and time limited execution plan no longer than 5 years
87,to the extent possible and on a best effort basis  all material risks that have been identified through a climate risk assessment For existing activities the implementation of those physical and nonphysical measures may be phased and executed over a period of time of up to 5 years For new activities implementation of these measures must be met at the time of design and construction
88,The economic activity and its adaptation measures do not increase the risks of an adverse climate impact on other people nature and assets or hamper adaptation elsewhere Consideration should be given to the viability of green or naturebasedsolutions over grey measures to address adaptation
89,In accordance with Article 14 of the Taxonomy proposal the DNSH criteria aim to specify the minimum requirements to be met to avoid significant harm to environmental objectives relevant to each economic activity Article 12 provides further details on what constitutes significant harm for each environmental objective
90,where that activity is detrimental to the good status or where relevant the good ecological potential of water bodies including surface waters and groundwaters or to the good environmental status of marine waters
91,where that activity leads to significant inefficiencies in the use of materials and the direct or indirect use of natural resources such as nonrenewable energy sources raw materials water and land in one or more stages of the lifecycle of products including in terms of durability reparability upgradability reusability or recyclability of products or where that activity leads to a significant increase in the generation incineration or disposal of waste with the exception of incineration of non recyclable hazardous waste or where the long term disposal of waste may cause significant and longterm harm to the environment
92,where that activity is detrimental to a significant extent to the good condition and resilience of ecosystems or where that activity is detrimental to the conservation status of habitats and species including those of Community interest
93,In addition the regulation specifies that for all objectives the environmental impacts of the activity itself as well as of the products and services provided by that activity throughout their life cycle shall be taken into account notably by considering their production use and endof life
94,The technical screening criteria proposed by the TEG contain quantitative thresholds where possible Where this is not possible the criteria are qualitative describing an action or set of actions to be demonstrated which avoid significant harm
95,The baseline scenario for the economic activities is compliance with relevant EU environmental legislation To this end the criteria take into account existing EU legislation The call for additional expertise to inform the TEG and the process described below enabled the establishment of criteria based on available scientific evidence Where evidence was not conclusive the precautionary principle enshrined in article 191 TFEU was taken into account as required in Article 14 of the draft regulation
96,To the extent possible the screening criteria whether qualitative or quantitative were selected to facilitate the verification of compliance In many instances the proposed criteria are expressed in terms of compliance with relevant EU legislation andor associated reference information such as the best available techniques BAT reference documents also known as BREFs15
97,Figure 9 presents an overview of the process for development of DNSH technical screening criteria against activities expected to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation For each activity the scope was reviewed to identify life cycle aspects and activity boundaries Where linkages with other activities occurred ie where life cycle aspects overlapped with other activities this has been referenced in the analysis
98,Initial screen for activities which could cause significant harm to each environmental objective This analysis was carried out within the scope defined for the economic activity as identified for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives In this analysis TEG members and additional experts have considered all material life cycle stages of the performance of the economic activity within the scope of the mitigation screening criteria
99,15 The BREF list of reference documents have been drawn or are planned to be drawn as part of the exchange of information carried out in the framework of Article 131 of the Industrial Emissions Directive IED 201075EU and other policylegislative instruments BREF are available at httpeippcbjrceceuropaeureference
100,criteria for DNSH in accordance with Article 141f of the Taxonomy proposal16 This approach provided a robust way to avoid errors such as considering sustainable any economic activity that may have negative effects during its upstream or downstream stages Questions asked and resolved included
101,3 Sectoral activities with high mitigation potential not included in the Taxonomy Where significant harm to one or more environmental objectives by the activity cannot be avoided through TEG requirements the activity was not included in the Taxonomy Material issues whereby an activity is considered unsuitable for inclusion in the Taxonomy may include but are not limited to lack of empirical data for reasonable evaluation of DNSH in line with the precautionary approach lockin and intergenerational risks
102,Authoritative publications were reviewed to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential environmental exposures and to identify material exposures for further consideration which may not be captured in existing EU legislation BEMP BAT and BREF
103,resources circular economy pollution prevention and the control and protection of ecosystems is advanced at the EU level with associated methodologies and thresholds as contained in the existing body of EU environmental law ie the environmental acquis17 Existing EU legal requirements apply across the Taxonomy Therefore for an activity to be included it must at minimum comply with EU legal requirements as well as national legal requirements and requirements relating to the environmental permits needed for its operation EU legal requirements were considered as minimum requirements and were in general not repeated in the DNSH evaluation When an environmental impact was considered significant the relevant EU legal requirements including BREF andor national requirements were included in the DNSH criteria unless more specific requirements were deemed necessary to avoid significant harm
104,6 Global Context The Taxonomy can potentially be used for economic activities outside of the EU The technical screening criteria for DNSH provide necessary performance levels or thresholds for EU issued financial products
105,16 Article 141f states The technical screening criteria adopted in accordance with Articles 62 72 82 92 102 and 112 shall take into account the environmental impacts of the economic activity itself as well as of the products and services provided by that economic activity notably by considering their production use and endoflife
106,mitigation scope of activities However for a small number of activities two or three differing sets of DNSH criteria were deemed necessary As an example within the manufacturing macro sector NACE code 2013 Manufacture of other inorganic basic chemicals there is one set of mitigation criteria and three sets of DNSH criteria divided into soda ash carbon black and chlorine
107,This report uses NACE for industry classification and the TEG has developed screening criteria for priority sectors within NACE Other activities may be also eligible so long as the company or investor can demonstrate compliance with the substantial contribution criteria and that no significant harm has been done to any other environmental objective
108,For some corporates who manufacture as well as sell the end products they may attribute revenue to the end product rather than to the manufacturing process Technical screening criteria in this report lays out expectations of the manufacturing process When aligning testing criteria to manufacturing it may be necessary to review revenue classified to the sale of the end product by the same organisation even though the eligible activity would be assessed within the manufacturing processes This is not a supply chain assessment the corporate needs to own the manufacturing process to qualify
109,When considering an activity that does not align with the provided NACE codes it may be possible that the activities of that corporate can still make a substantial contribution to one or more of the environmental objectives This activity can be considered eligible so long as the testing criteria that exist within the report are satisfied
110,Activities of main and secondary building contractors can be found within NACE 43 with additional subsectors under NACE 42 The activities of these companies could be considered eligible as enabling activities if they contribute to construction activities that comply with the taxonomy criteria set under New Constructions and Renovations Eligibility would need to be assessed on a projectbyproject basis as a contractor would have different projects within their portfolio of work some complying with the taxonomy and others not
111,Activities of manufacturers of building products and machinery subsectors within NACE 16 23 and 28 could be considered eligible as enabling activities if they produce low carbon technologies for buildings for example efficient windows insulation etc and comply with the criteria set out within the manufacturing section of this report
112,Real estate brokers and agencies NACE 6831 activities could be considered eligible as Enabling Activities if they support the acquisition of properties that comply with the criteria set for calculated performance in acquisition  ownership but this would have to be assessed and disclosed on an acquisitionbyacquisition basis
113,Property management NACE 6832  Activities of these companies could be considered eligible as Enabling Activities if they satisfy the criteria for measured performance set in Acquisition  Ownership compliance would have to be assessed on a propertybyproperty basis
114,Green debt or lending activities may be allocated a NACE or equivalent industry classification code Where financial instruments are allocated a NACE listed in this report the substantial contribution and significant harm tests can be applied as listed However there may be some examples where the activity may be suitable to test even if the industry or sector of the overall business may not be listed within this report Such examples include
115,Where the proceeds of a bond or loan are allocated to a project and the project is allocated across more than one sector eg solar hydro and wind investments then each of the projects or assets shall meet the specific eligibility criteria provided within this taxonomy report Production of Electricity from Hydropower Solar PV or Wind Power If the capital allocation to the projects was split evenly across the three activities and only one of the projects satisfied the technical screening criteria then only 33 of the investment would qualify
116,Where the proceeds of a bond or loan are allocated to a project or asset that sits outside of the normal industry classification of the asset owner eg Agricultural upgrade of farming vehicles to electric vehicles then the nature of the project or asset needs to be assessed in line with the appropriate taxonomy testing criteria In this example the assets electric vehicles would qualify under Transport  50g CO2Km even though the bond or loan may be classified under Agriculture
117,Where a corporate in an industry not covered within this report wishes to invest in new infrastructure that would enable more energy efficiency in their process and those projects allow the corporate to meet the technical screening criteria then they would qualify Demonstration of the technical screening criteria met would be required in the associated prospectus
118,The Taxonomy defines forest in accordance with the definitions of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization18 In this context a forest is considered as Land spanning more than 05 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use UNFAO 201919 In the context of the Taxonomy plantations forests are specifically excluded Plantations are defined by the FAO as Planted Forest that is intensively managed and meet ALL the following criteria at planting and stand maturity one or two species even age class and regular spacing 1 Specifically includes short rotation plantation for wood fibre and energy 2 Specifically excludes forest planted for protection or ecosystem restoration 3 Specifically excludes Forest established through planting or seeding which at stand maturity resembles or will resemble naturally regenerating forest Recognising that countries or country groups may set specific definitions of forest to represent specific regional conditions the Taxonomy allows for the use of forest definitions developed under regional processes such as Forest Europe and various agreements such as the International Tropical Timber Agreement etc providing that these are aligned with the FAO definition When applying to be Taxonomy aligned the specific definition if different from FAO should be set out and the alignment with FAO definition demonstrated clearly
119,For the purposes of the Taxonomy significant mitigation achievement for Forestry is judged through improvement in activities own performance with a focus on the maintenance of forest carbon stocks and sinks and increase of sequestration potential within the sector Forests cover around 30 of the global landmass in Europe this figure is higher at 4045 and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year20 Forests regulate ecosystems protect biodiversity play an integral part in the carbon cycle support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth EU forests already account for more than 20 of the global forest carbon sink and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a netzero target by 2050 in Europe and globally21
120,Given the necessity to maintain the existing forest carbon sink conservation finance is enabled within the forest sector ie finance that supports the maintenance and protection of forest areas regardless of whether they are used for economic production The introduction of conservation forests that may have no productive function into the Taxonomy should aid in the alignment of the Taxonomy as it develops to include substantial contribution to other environmental objectives
121,Approximately 48 191 Mt of the biomass produced from EU forests is consumed as energy with the remaining 52 209 Mt used in its material form Camia et al 201822 It is important to recognise that these two figures are not mutually independent and that the energy end use of forest biomass seldom arise solely from whole trees harvested for that purpose The Taxonomy recognises the principles put forward in the EU Forestry Strategy advancing both the benefits of sustainable forest management and the multifunctional role of forests23
122,Despite this split between material and energy use in the context of the bioeconomy the revenue and employment generated from the two uses is significantly different 18 of the overall EU bioeconomy revenue is generated from the energetic use of biomass compared to 27 for material production Forestry as an employment sector adds a further 22 EEA 201824
123,Forests are exposed to the effects of climate change such as changes in weather patterns eg extreme heatwaves and pest and diseases outbreaks In Europe alone more wildfires have been recorded in the first four months of 2019 than in the whole of 201825 and while in the EU the forest area is increasing on the global scale deforestation remains the secondleading cause of climate change after the burning of fossil fuels26 The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC estimates that an additional USD 14 billion in financial flows will be required to address climate impacts in agriculture forestry and fisheries globally in 203027 That includes the implementation of mitigation projects but also ensuring the resilience of forests to climatic changes the proactive protection of forest ecosystems biodiversity habitats and soil as well as the sustainable provision of raw material for the forestbased industry The Taxonomy recognises the impact of climate conditions and changing environments it includes a clause for force majeure that states that underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds  and will not result in non compliance with the Taxonomy criteria28
124,The role of forests in the global greenhouse gas balance can be enhanced through the implementation of costeffective mitigation options within the forestry sector greening of including rehabilitation of degraded forests reforestation sustainable forest management conservation and afforestation The reduction of deforestation across the globe is also essential but caused often by factors outside of the

126,28 In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or windthrow the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE and performance will be judged on the basis of the reestablishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20years
127,forest sector such as agriculture or urban expansion2930 Forest based products can have climate mitigation benefits when used in other economic sectors enabling through the reduction of GHG emissions and substitution effects Two forms of substitution are foreseen The substitution of GHG intensive materials with harvested wood products HWP eg woodbased raw materials and products used in construction and the substitution of fossilbased fuels These two forms of substitution differ materially in their impact on GHG emissions and approach to Carbon reductions At this point the forest Taxonomy focuses on greening of activities to protect and enhance forest carbon stocks and sinks It is recommended that the Commission consider how enabling activities involving longlived and harvested wood products could operate within the Taxonomy A proposal for considerations for the Taxonomy set out in Annex F1
128,The scope of the Taxonomy emphasizes carbon sequestration and carbon storage in forests through forest management activities that apply up to the forest gate The selected activities represent interventions at different stages of a forests economic life cycle and have been scoped under the NACE code A2  Forestry and logging They include
129,Reforestation FAO FRA 2020 Definition the reestablishment of forest through planting andor deliberate seeding on land classified as forest The FAO FRA definition of reforestation excludes natural regeneration However the Taxonomy recognises the importance of natural regeneration to the increased carbon sink and stock potential provided by forests in general It is therefore included explicitly within this context in line with the FAO FRA definition of naturally regenerating forest 31
130,Sustainable Forest Management principles SFM is further defined by Forest Europe as sustainable forest management means using forests and forest land in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfil now and in the
131,30 While the forest Taxonomy focuses on enhancing the mitigation potential of forestry activities it reinforces the importance of reducing deforestation globally and reiterates the importance of the international guiding principles against deforestation provided by the UNREDD
132,Explanatory notes 1 Includes forests for which it is not possible to distinguish whether planted or naturally regenerated 2 Includes forests with a mix of naturally regenerated native tree species and plantedseeded trees and where the naturally regenerated trees are expected to constitute the major part of the growing stock at stand maturity 3 Includes coppice from trees originally established through natural regeneration 4 Includes naturally regenerated trees of introduced species
133,designated management objective FAO FRA definition is that of conservation Specifically those forests where the management objectives are conservation of biodiversity or social services based on the FAO FRA definitions Box 1
134,c Nationwide general management objectives established in national legislation or policies such as eg all forest land should be managed for production conservation and social purposes should not be considered as management objectives in this context
135,Due to changes in practices in the category afforestation and reforestation which changes from practices connected with newly established forest to first tending operations it is proposed to transfer these two categories to the NACE category existing forest management or conservation forestry depending on the objective of the management after the 20 years period following the EU LULUCF
136,accounting rule of 20 years Similarly if there is largescale harvesting the NACE category will move from existing forest management to that of reforestation Within the EU reforestation after harvesting is a requirement yet this is not the situation globally The Taxonomy adds value in this way in the global context Conservation forests may arise in a variety of forms such as designation or voluntary conservation and may be considered similar to the existing forest management NACE in the context of the Taxonomy The relationship with the other forest NACE is as follows Where conservation ceases to be the primary objective of the management of the stand the NACE will move to existing forest management Where there is a significant loss of forest for example fire or storm damage the NACE activity for ensuring substantial contribution to mitigation will become reforestation or  rehabilitationrestoration until 20 years at which point the NACE will become conservation forest again or existing forest management  depending on the objective of the forest management at that time
137,Harvesting practices such as thinning removals final fellings etc will temporarily reduce the carbon stock and the potential to sequester carbon However such forest management activities should be eligible under Taxonomy as long as SFM practices are in place and that carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon are maintained or increased over the rotation period of the forest or where selective removal of trees is required as part of the forest conservation plan The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest
138,Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation eg the Renewable Energy Directive and its recast EU LULUCF EU Nature Directives EU FLEGT EU Timber Regulation etc national forest legislation international standards and best practices and international processes such as the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe Forest Europe The Taxonomy recognizes that although the EU has a variety of forestrelated policies the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights which include a long history of longterm planning in national and regional regulations
139,The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative increasing andor maintained in the case of existing forest management and permanent All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation Specifically they are
140,1 Criterion 1 Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management SFM requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services SFM is defined as the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfil now and in the future relevant ecological economic and social functions at local national and global levels and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems33 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory but allow flexibility for the adoption of
141,approaches that are regionally appropriate providing that they are justified and apply internationally provided they can be verified via independent thirdparty schemes that are regularly audited or under international agreements This will allow investors and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally 34 The practices set out in Annex F2 represent a nonexhaustive list of activities that would if implemented effectively lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks and conservation of nonproductive functions The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated exante as leading to the same outcome
142,Criterion 1 differs in the context of conservation forests as a result of those forests having a defined conservation objective and where timber production is not the primary objective The Taxonomy recognises that its initial goal is to deliver substantial mitigation and thus for conservation forests focusses on the maintenance of the forest carbon sink A forest conservation plan is required in order to ensure that substantial mitigation is delivered in this case maintenance and increase of carbon sinks in line with wider conservation objectives This differs from the requirements under the other forest NACE in that there may be zero intervention requirements andor requires only those management activities listed under Category C in Annex F2 Any necessary harvesting for example diseased trees should be carried out in line with the conservation plan
143,curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools above and belowground but recognises the challenges of belowground carbon measurement Therefore the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of aboveground carbon pools only
144,and 2 as reported through a forest management plan or equivalent instruments at 10year intervals to be subsequently reviewed by an independent thirdparty certifier andor competent authorities Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years for afforestation and reforestation projects and shall increase over the rotation period for restoration projects and be maintained or increased in the case of existing forest management and conservation forests
145,Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline over the rotation period of the forest which reflects and adapts to the industrys levels of maturity climate conditions location features and market structures The Taxonomy recognises the commercial function of forests and the importance of enabling a sustainable finance market in those
146,34 FSCPEFC estimate that about 54 of forests globally are productive andor used for multiple purposes of which 20 are certified by FSC and PEFC See Data about Share Forest Certification FSCPEFC in Forest Management John Hontelez FSC International 30 April 2019
147,forests Therefore a pragmatic view has been taken to the performance period which differs between forest NACE codes as set out in Criterion 3 above For afforestation and reforestation it is recognised that there will be a measurable increase in carbon stock as the forest stand develops and trees grow For existing forest management and restorationrehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages of maturity within the context of an established forest From a substantial mitigation perspective the view is taken that the maintenance of the carbon stock of the forest is important and recognises that beyond a point carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the aboveground biomass Respecting the commercial function of many forests forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation However providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of netannual increment the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time
148,In practical terms for existing forest management and for rehabilitationrestoration of forests the forest owner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate relative to the rotation period that carbon stocks have been maintained against baseline or increased from baseline Importantly the performancedemonstration period is linked to the rotation period but supported through 10year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel ie that carbon stocks are being maintained or increasing In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or windthrow the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE and performance will be judged on the basis of the reestablishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20years
149,Measurement and reporting shall not result in significant burden to smallscale operators that may benefit from private investment as the Taxonomy builds on EU legislation and existing national frameworks and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level These include approaches adopted at the national or subnationalregional level sourcingarea level multiple holdings or individual holding level The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment
150,Mitigation activities in the forest Taxonomy focus on the maintenance and increase of the forest carbon sink whilst reducing and avoiding the GHG emissions from activities Primary producing sectors such as forestry are particularly vulnerable to climaterelated changes and shocks eg changing weather patterns heatwaves etc Adaptation of forests is therefore essential if the carbon sinks are to be maintained the stocks increased Adaptation requirements should be framed so as to promote synergies with substantial mitigation where possible and as a minimum lead to no significant harm
151,The text of the proposed Taxonomy Regulation Article 12a For the purposes of Article 3b an economic activity shall be considered as significantly harming a climate change mitigation where that activity leads to significant greenhouse gas emissions
152,Forests are an unusual economic sector in which they provide a substantial carbon sink and that significant harm for forest climate change mitigation include where an adaptation activity leads to a significant longterm reduction of the carbon sink It is therefore important to maintain the forest area and
153,Energy Directive EU20182001 which determines the requirement for management systems to be in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term35
154,Approximately 430000 enterprises are active in woodbased industries across the EU representing 20 of EU manufacturing enterprises and 75 of the gross valueadded of the manufacturing industry in Europe36 The wood industry provides around 35 million jobs in the EU37 Around 60 of EU forests are privately owned of which 23 have holdings of less than 3 hectares 38 many times fragmented into smaller plots The structure of private forest ownership is specific and considerable variations exist from country to country with properties sizes ranging from 05 hectares to more than 10000 hectares while the average size is around 13 hectares Forest owners and managers with similar forest characteristics under similar climate conditions and jurisdictions are expected to be equally impacted
155,Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy with the exception of the Conversion criteria This equates to 615 of total productive forests in the EU39 and around 20 of productive forests globally40 Other forestsforest
156,35 Article 29 of the recast RED sets out sustainability criteria for forests to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term This is explicitly defined in Article 297b which requires management systems are in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term This places the emphasis of the no significant harm requirement at a level more appropriate for the operation of the Taxonomy andor investment rather than relying on national level requirements
157,projects ie noncertified may also meet the criteria but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with certainty Whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 ex Conversion criteria and the DNSH criteria verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required including carbon measurement and performance
158,Progress and performance in relation to aboveground carbon sequestration is measured relative to the verified baseline therefore any forest ownermanager is offered the opportunity to progress in accordance with its specific constrains and maturity level It is unclear what proportion of the market already implements carbon sequestration measurements against a verified baseline but examples of specific company progress assessments are available to demonstrate proof of concept
159,From a reporting perspective the Taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks The Taxonomy allows for performancerelated information to either be reported and disclosed by the forest ownerforest management company directly or through existing integrated reporting mechanisms in place at the level of the jurisdiction whether this is at the sourcing area level multiple holdings regional or national level The Taxonomy recognises the importance of landscape scale approaches ie multiple forest stands in how the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest sink increment is managed and the economic lifetime of forest operations within which the carbon stock may rise and fall within an overall upward trajectory The current bestperformers are expected to be able to comply with the Taxonomy criteria through their existing reporting and management requirements It is also recognised that some will need more time and thus the Taxonomy provides an incentive to improve performance within the global forest sector
160,The following issues have not been addressed in this version of the forest Taxonomy criteria However they may provide additional mitigation opportunities for the sector and therefore merit consideration by the Platform on Sustainable Finance
161,The forest Taxonomy sets out criteria and thresholds for forest management activities that apply up to the forest gate irrespective of the enduse of the forest products This is for the pragmatic reason that many forest managers and owners do not know in which supply chains their products will arise In principle however the Taxonomy recognises the holistic mitigation potential of forests and wood beyond the forest gate both through the effect of substitution replacing more GHG intensive materials and through the longterm carbon sink potential of wood products Furthermore the forest Taxonomy deals with the production and supply of forest biomass but not the demand or end use of that biomass The relationship between the end use of biomass and its production ie market pull is an important component of the overall sustainable finance Taxonomy to consider when incentivising different NACE sectors towards substantial contribution to mitigation At present climate benefits beyond the forest gate are expected to be captured through the constructionbuilding energy and manufacturing sector Taxonomies and thus create an incentive for the use of wood in the economy and thus the management of forests in compliance with the Taxonomy The Platform should therefore improve the holistic consideration of forests and forest products mitigation potential across their entire value chains and across all sectors of the economy including end of life The following recommendations are made in the context of other NACE sectors
162,buildings and construction activities utilising wood These thresholds should be based on a wide and consistent set of data able to benchmark best practice across different building uses and typologies ie houses flats offices etc In parallel the methodology to be used to assess embodied emissions should be defined in detail on the basis of widelyaccepted LCA and CENTC350 standards with particular care to ensure that the beneficial impact of carbon sequestration in timber products sourced from sustainablymanaged forests is adequately recognised This should include the end of life of wood and construction timber
163,mitigation benefits and should be considered with priority for construction as a criteria for substantial contribution to mitigation This would aid in incentivising the use of wood within the economy and for the longterm sequestration of carbon in timber products In the current proposals
164,o The manufacturing Taxonomy should systematically consider the substitution potential of wood as a manufacturing material Progress has been made in this regard under current NACE 47 Manufacture of other organic base chemicals This approach is welcomed and should be expanded across other manufacturing NACE sectors Specifically it is suggested that the manufacturing Taxonomy includes NACE C16 Manufacture of wood and of products of wood and cork except furniture manufacture of articles of straw and plaiting materials and C31 Manufacture of furniture and develop robust and verifiable substitution criteria to ensure substantial mitigation and DNSH criteria see above proposal for buildings
165,the forest during the lifetime of a forest project or activity For example the Taxonomy does not account for fuel use by machinery within the forest sector which is currently accounted for in the energy and transport sectors
166, GHG measurement is required for aboveground carbon sequestration on the basis that below ground carbon is technically more challenging to assess and measure overtime Instead below ground carbon shall be maintained andor increased through a proxy ie the application of management practices reflected through cumulative Sustainable Forest Management and Do No Significant Harm requirements The Platform is advised to further explore belowground carbon measurements and review existing impact assessment methodologies that might complement the current threshold for belowground carbon measurements It is further suggested that the Platform consider the approach to soilcarbon in the agriculture Taxonomy and whether there should be alignment also for the forest Taxonomy
167,It is the view of the TEG that these criteria are relevant internationally provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches such as forest certification using independent thirdparty schemes that are regularly audited It is recommended that the Platform further develops guidance including a more granular mapping of the Taxonomy criteria and thresholds with existing internationally recognised and applicable forest certification schemes This would provide support to investors and forest management companies and individuals when seeking compliance with the Taxonomy
168,In the context of interlinkages between Taxonomy sectors the impact of deforestation is often a result of othersector activities such as agriculture or building development rather than forestry The Platform are invited to consider whether deforestation is sufficiently addressed in other Taxonomy sectors in order to support substantial contribution in the forest sector and as a DNSH to mitigation in the forest sector as enabled through other Taxonomy sectors
169,The Platform should further explore potential enduser issues and opportunities for investors and financial institutions including potential challenges that may arise in relation to associating capital expenditures or revenues that can be tagged or screened through the current criteria set for forest managementland use activities For example an investor may invest in a wood processing facility which itself is not covered by the current forest Taxonomy sectors but the operation of the facility will interact with the management of forests and the use of forest products Clarity should be provided to investors on where and at what point in the valuesupply chain they are expected to consider compliance with the Taxonomy  specifically for sectors upstream or downstream of the specific investment
170,existing forest management NACE With the proposed Taxonomy for existing forest management a pragmatic view has been taken to align performance with the commercial rotation period of a forest  ie allowing for changes in carbon stock within a forest and providing flexibility given that different forests will be harvested at different periods This implicitly recognises that the forest will remain forest and when managed under SFM continue to sequester carbon Importantly this means that the forest may be harvested at a commercial point determined by wood quality and quantity and not at a point where the forest has reached a carbon stock saturation point  which may be considerably longer The Platform is therefore asked to consider if it is sufficient to have additionality provided through SFM and DNSH but that for existing forest management substantial contribution can be judged as the maintenance of the forest carbon stock rather than its increase Whilst the focus of this Taxonomy is on greening of activities it may be relevant to consider the end use of the forest biomass when reflecting on this point  in that around
171,Afforestation is defined as the establishment of forest through planting andor deliberate seeding on land that until then was under a different land use implies a transformation of land use from nonforest to forest41
172,Identify and apply forest management practices that increase existing carbon stocks considering the nonexhaustive list of examples practices in the Annex F2 however allowing for application of other similar approaches that recognise local specificities and conditions while maintaining or improving soil quality and biodiversity
173,requirements is demonstrated and disclosed at 10year intervals through a forest management plan or equivalent that shall be reviewed by an independent thirdparty certifier andor competent authorities as described in Criteria 3
174,Verified GHG balance baseline43 is calculated for aboveground carbon pools based on growthyield curves for species per m3yearha carbon convertible Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area the species and number of trees in case of afforestation and reforestation Using the growthyield curves information will be given on the annual increment in m3yearha which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories IPCC Guidelines it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide
175,a period of 20 years44 Changes in carbon stocks should be disclosed based on growth yield curves in 10 year intervals through a forest management plan or equivalent instrument45 that shall be reviewed by an independent thirdparty certifier andor competent authorities as described in Criteria 346
176,43 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area the species and number of trees in case of planting The increment based on the growthyield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3yearha is available for increment The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide
177,45 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single forest stand Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand The Forest Taxonomy leaves to forest owners and companies to explain document on which level they report
178,46 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in noncompliance with the Taxonomy criteria
179,play an integral part in the carbon cycle support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth EU forests already account for more than 20 of the global forest carbon sink and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a netzero target by 2050 in Europe and globally48
180,Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas GHG emission mitigation through sequestration of carbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils vegetation leaf litter and dead wood up to forest gate
181,The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that although the EU has a variety of forestrelated policies the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights which include a long history of long term planning in national and regional regulations
182,The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative increasing and permanent All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation Specifically they are
183,1 Criterion 1 Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management SFM requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services SFM is defined as the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfil now and in the future relevant ecological economic and social functions at local national and global levels and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems49 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate providing that they are justified and apply internationally provided they can be verified via independent thirdparty schemes that are regularly audited or under international agreements This will allow investors forest
184,To help with application of the criteria the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a nonexhaustive list of activities that would if implemented effectively lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks and conservation of nonproductive functions The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated exante as leading to the same outcome
185,2 Criterion 2 The establishment of a verified GHG balance baseline based on growth yield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to increase and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools above and belowground as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B Specifically a aboveground biomass b belowground biomass c litter d dead wood e soil organic carbon with the exclusion of f harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy However it recognises the challenges of belowground carbon measurement Therefore the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of aboveground carbon pools only
186,The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of

188,number of trees in case of afforestation and reforestation Using the growthyield curves information will be given on the annual increment in m3yearha which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories IPCC Guidelines it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide
189,1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan or equivalent instruments at 10year intervals to be subsequently reviewed by an independent thirdparty certifier andor competent authorities Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over a period of 20 years for afforestation projects  In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living aboveground biomass specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects
190,demonstrated after 20 years of the afforestationreforestation project This aligns with the measurement of carbon and under LULUCF regulation where land that was afforested moves from category afforestation to forest land after 20 years A 20year period for maintaining carbon sinks and activities also follows the IPCC time frame of 20 years to saturation for soil carbon
191,may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level These include approaches adopted at the national or subnationalregional level sourcingarea level multiple holdings or individual holding level The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment

212,The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that although the EU has a variety of forestrelated policies the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights which include a long history of long term planning in national and regional regulations
213,The Taxonomy sets out the following three qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure sustainable management of forest areas a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative increasing and permanent All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation Specifically they are
214,1 Criterion 1 Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management SFM requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest ecosystems and forest services SFM is defined as the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfil now and in the future relevant ecological economic and social functions at local national and global levels and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems63 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate providing that they are justified
215,and apply internationally provided they can be verified via independent thirdparty schemes that are regularly audited or under international agreements This will allow investors forest owners buyers of timber andor residues and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally64
216,To help with application of the criteria the Forest mitigation Taxonomy provides in Annex F2 a nonexhaustive list of activities that would if implemented effectively lead to the achievement of the objectives of the Taxonomy in the context of maintain and increase carbon stocks and conservation of nonproductive functions The aim of the list is to provide support to operators and investors as to the types of practice that should be implemented Recognising the different conditions and characteristics of regions and forests another practice could be applied and can be demonstrated exante as leading to the same outcome

219, The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining andor increasing carbon stocks specifically the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks
220,number of trees in case of afforestation and reforestation Using the growthyield curves information will be given on the annual increment in m3yearha which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories IPCC Guidelines it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide
221,criterion 1 and 2 as reported through a forest management plan or equivalent instruments at 10year intervals to be subsequently reviewed by an independent thirdparty certifier andor competent authorities Carbon stocks shall increase above the carbon baseline over the rotation period of the forest for restoration projects
222,In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living aboveground biomass specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects
223,demonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline over the rotation period of the forest which reflects and adapts to the industrys levels of maturity climate conditions location features and market structures For restorationrehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages of maturity within the context of an established forest From a substantial mitigation perspective the view is taken that the maintenance of the carbon stock of the forest is important and recognises that beyond a point carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the aboveground biomass Respecting the commercial function of many forests forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation However providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of netannual increment the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time In practical terms for rehabilitationrestoration of forests the forest owner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate relative to the rotation period that carbon stocks have been maintained against baseline or increased from baseline Importantly the performancedemonstration period is linked to the rotation period but supported through 10year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel ie that carbon stocks are being maintained or increasing In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or windthrow the existing forest management NACE will move to the

284,stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining andor increasing carbon stocks specifically the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks
285,number of trees in case of afforestation and reforestation Using the growthyield curves information will be given on the annual increment in m3yearha which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories IPCC Guidelines it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide

287,In order for forests to achieve their full climate mitigation potential it is essential the Taxonomy accounts for both a continuum of sustainable forest management practices and the demonstration that the carbon stocks increment includes the impact from living aboveground biomass specifically in the case of afforestation and reforestation projects
288,SFM requirements are essential to guarantee the maintenance in carbon sequestration from belowground biomass dead organic matter or soils increase in carbon sequestration from below ground carbon pools is not included due to the high uncertainty in measuring it
289,demonstrated relative to the rotation period of the forest Progress in the forest carbon inventory and evolution of the forest increment is required relative to a verified baseline over the rotation period of the forest which reflects and adapts to the industrys levels of maturity climate conditions location features and market structures For restorationrehabilitation the forest will include stands at varying stages of maturity within the context of an established forest From a substantial mitigation perspective the view is taken that the maintenance of the
290,carbon stock of the forest is important and recognises that beyond a point carbon stocks may reach a saturation point in the aboveground biomass Respecting the commercial function of many forests forests may be harvested before reaching full maturity or saturation However providing the harvesting follows SFM practices and remains below the level of netannual increment the overall forest carbon sink is expected to remain stable or increase over time In practical terms for rehabilitationrestoration of forests the forest owner will be required to define the rotation period of a given forest whether at the stand level or landscape level In order to comply with criterion 2 and 3 the forest owner will need to demonstrate relative to the rotation period that carbon stocks have been maintained against baseline or increased from baseline Importantly the performancedemonstration period is linked to the rotation period but supported through 10year reporting periods in order to show direction of travel ie that carbon stocks are being maintained or increasing In the event of force majeure such as the loss of a forest stand from fire or windthrow the existing forest management NACE will move to the restoration NACE and performance will be judged on the basis of the reestablishment of the forest stand and thus carbon stock development over a period of 20years
291,may benefit from private investment as the taxonomy builds on EU legislation and national frameworks and recognises the applicability of different scales of reporting through existing approaches to verification and assessment that apply above the individual holding level These include approaches adopted at the national or subnationalregional level sourcingarea level multiple holdings or individual holding level The Taxonomy does not specify which reporting framework is used and thus allows flexibility to adapt to the national context providing that the compliance with criteria and thresholds can be assessed for the holding level as appropriate for the investment
292,carbon stock and the potential to sequester carbon However such forest management activities should be eligible under Taxonomy as long as SFM practices are in place and that carbon sinks of above and below ground carbon are maintained or increased over the rotation period of the forest or where selective removal of trees is required as part of the forest conservation plan The rotation period is here defined as the time from seeding planting or natural regeneration through to the point of harvest
293,It is the view of the TEG that the proposed criteria are relevant internationally provided compliance with the criteria can be informed by providing evidence for meeting compliance or applying verification approaches such as forest certification using independent thirdparty schemes that are regularly audited Forestry operations that are FSC and PEFC certified are likely to meet the SFM and Do No Significant Harm criteria of the forest Taxonomy with the exception of the Conversion criteria that varies across jurisdictions and forestry activities This equates to 615 of total productive forests in the EU94 and around 20 of productive forests globally95 Other forestsforest projects ie non
294,certified may also meet the criteria but it is not possible to estimate this part of the market with certainty Note whilst FSC and PEFC may satisfy Criterion 1 ex Conversion criteria and the DNSH criteria verification of compliance with all three of the Taxonomy criteria will be required including carbon measurement and performance
295,In order to ensure compliance with the criteria set out in the Taxonomy it is appropriate to consider alignment with existing EU legislative instruments The proposed criteria and DNSH requirements align with existing EU legislation in the context of forestry It is important to recognise where legislation provides safeguards to ensure no harm to an objective and where legislation allows for more substantial contribution to those objectives For example Article 29 of the recast RED sets out sustainability criteria for forests using a riskbased approach to minimise the risk of using forest biomass derived from unsustainable production relaying in Article 296 on national or subnational laws or if such evidence is not available on supply level and in Article 297 referring to the Paris agreement or if such evidence is not available it refers to management systems in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term These aims are to an extent consistent with that the criteria proposed in the Taxonomy and some of the DNSH criteria Where the existing recast RED differs is that Article 29 does not require an explicit substantial contribution to GHG mitigation Furthermore the compliance mechanism by which the RED seeks to ensure that these aims are achieved is riskbased however through a verification process A riskbased approach assumes that if national laws or management systems are in place that the RED criteria are addressed The Taxonomy seeks to establish specific and measurable criteria metrics and thresholds by which substantial mitigation can be assessed at the project level or at the level of the forest holding
296,The DNSH criteria below should be considered in combination with the SFM requirements of the forest mitigation Taxonomy criterion 1 The criteria can be informed by applying forest certification using independent thirdparty schemes that are regularly audited Compliance shall be reported through a forest management plan or equivalent as per criterion 3 of the forest mitigation Taxonomy

305,carbon pools based on growthyield curves for species per m3yearha carbon convertible Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area the species and number of trees Using the growthyield curves information will be given on the annual increment in m3yearha which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories IPCC Guidelines it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide

307,100 Calculating the GHG balance baseline requires knowledge of the area the species and number of trees in case of planting The increment based on the growthyield curves gives the approximate number of how many m3yearha is available for increment The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide
308,101 Landscape management level may be used to emphasize that the goal may be to perform at a scale above the single forest stand Absence of landscape management access will in turn require disclosure at the single forest stand The Forest Taxonomy leaves to forest owners and companies to explain document on which level they report
309,102 This threshold should apply considering the following force majeure clause underperformance resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not result in noncompliance with the Taxonomy criteria
310,Given the objectives of the Taxonomy conservation finance should be enabled within the forest sector and conservation forest  which may have no productive value  recognised for their carbon sink role It is therefore proposed that conservation forests are recognised in the Taxonomy provided they can demonstrate maintenance of high carbon stocks in multiple pools and overall improvement in the forest carbon sink
311,Conservation forests are that in which the primary designated management objective FAO FRA definition is that of conservation Specifically those forests where the management objectives are conservation of biodiversity or social services based on the FAO FRA definitions103
312,c Nationwide general management objectives established in national legislation or policies such as eg all forest land should be managed for production conservation and social purposes should not be considered as management objectives in this context
313,Forests cover around 30 of the global landmass In Europe this figure is higher at 4045 and absorb roughly 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide each year104 Forests regulate ecosystems protect biodiversity play an integral part in the carbon cycle support livelihoods and can help drive sustainable growth EU forests already account for more than 20 of the global forest carbon sink and yet an increase in carbon sequestration from forests is essential to the achievement of a netzero target by 2050 in Europe and globally105
314,Forests can deliver substantial greenhouse gas GHG emission mitigation through sequestration of carbon during tree growth and in the accumulation of biomass in soils vegetation leaf litter and dead wood up to forest gate
315,The Taxonomy acknowledges a definitional change from conservation forest to existing forest management if the objectives of the forest management change or to restorationrehabilitation or reforestation should there be the loss of forest from force majeure
316,The approach taken to determine metrics and thresholds rely on cumulative criteria Selected criteria build on existing EU legislation and the Taxonomy recognizes that although the EU has a variety of forestrelated policies the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union makes no reference to specific provisions for an EU forest policy and that the responsibility for forests lies with the Member States within a defined framework of established ownership rights which include a long history of long term planning in national and regional regulations
317,The Taxonomy sets out the following qualitative and quantitative mitigation criteria to ensure a measured baseline for progress towards substantial mitigation and demonstration that this mitigation is cumulative increasing and permanent All three criteria are required to demonstrate sustainable and substantial mitigation Specifically they are
318,Criterion 1 Compliance with Sustainable Forest Management SFM requirements in order to ensure forest carbon stocks are retained whilst supporting forest conservation SFM is defined as the stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way and at a rate that maintains their biodiversity productivity regeneration capacity vitality and their potential to fulfil now and in the future relevant ecological economic and social functions at local national and global levels and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems106 The SFM requirements set in the Taxonomy are mandatory but allow flexibility for the adoption of approaches that are regionally appropriate providing that they are justified and
319,apply internationally provided they can be verified via independent thirdparty schemes that are regularly audited or under international agreements This will allow investors forest owners buyers of timber andor residues and forest management companies to verify compliance with the criteria in Europe and globally107 For conservation forests only the management activities listed under Category C in Annex F2 are required
320,yield curves in order to demonstrate that the forest carbon sink continues to be maintained or increased and GHG emissions from the forest sectors decrease This criterion implicitly considers all forest carbon pools above and belowground as identified in LULUCF regulation Annex I section B Specifically a aboveground biomass b belowground biomass c litter d dead wood e soil organic carbon with the exclusion of f harvested wood products in the land accounting categories of afforested land and managed forest land which is beyond the scope of this Taxonomy However it recognises the challenges of below ground carbon measurement Therefore the specific criteria used in the fiches focuses on the measurement of aboveground carbon pools only
321,The forest Taxonomy acknowledges that setting a universal absolute threshold for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration is highly context specific The Taxonomy therefore requires evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of maintaining andor increasing carbon stocks specifically the progressive increase of forest carbon stocks
322,number of trees in case of afforestation and reforestation Using the growthyield curves information will be given on the annual increment in m3yearha which can be used for the basis of the GHG balance The methodology is consistent with the approach in the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories IPCC Guidelines it recommends recalculation of the amount of carbon sequestered 1 ton of biomass representing approximately 05 ton of carbon Further one ton of carbon equals 4412  367 tons of carbon dioxide

337,The following text is a proposal for identifying what enabling activities for the Forest NACE sectors would look like and identifies questions regarding the operation of such a proposal in the context of the Taxonomy Enabling activities are defined in the Taxonomy Political Agreement Article 11a of December 2019 as An economic activity shall be considered to contribute substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives set out in Article 5 by directly enabling other activities to make a substantial contribution to one or more of those objectives and where that activity  a does not lead to a lockin in assets that undermine longterm environmental goals considering the economic lifetime of those assets b has a substantial positive environmental impact on the basis of lifecycle considerations
338,In simple terms the current forest taxonomy recognises activities that provide substantial mitigation up to the forest gate An enablingapproach would recognise where forest based products from the forest sector are supporting substantial mitigation beyond the forest gate ie in other sectors of the economy
339,Further recognising the role of forestbased products in the wider process of transitioning to the green economy could incentivise the sector in a positive way  generating demand for Taxonomy compliant forestry  and thus deliver cross sector incentives for substantial contribution to mitigation
340,Valorisation of the forestbased products contribution in the downstream sector The principles of the circular economy look towards the designing out waste and pollution keeping products and materials in use and regenerating natural systems Therefore forestbased products that have already been used within an economic sector other than forestry should become part of the circular economy and contribute in another sector  with the aim to keep the wood in its material form for as long as possible before disposal andor energy recovery This follows the principle of resource efficiency EU Forest Strategy described it as using forest resources in a way that minimises the impact on the environment and climate and prioritising the forest outputs that have higher addedvalue create more jobs and contribute to a better carbon balance This raises a key question as to the point at which the forestbased sector would be recognised for the initial material production as a means of substantial contribution and to contribute to substitution in multiple sectors where the same wood is used for their decarbonisation
341,Different Forest NACE The current proposal for a Forest Taxonomy includes five NACE sector distinctions Afforestation Reforestation Rehabilitationrestoration Existing Forest Management and Conservation Forests Would it be necessary to establish a link between the use of wood products in another economy NACE and a specific forest sector NACE If so which one as all form part of the forest management system How would this be done and what if a product is used in multiple NACE categories how to count the multiple substitution
342,Trans NACE reporting traceability and compliance The use of forestbased products in one sector of the economy may be supported through a separate investor say for building regeneration who is not investing in the forest sector The forest sector producers especially the owners mostly do not always know the enduse of the wood products passing beyond the forest gate However there would need to be in place some form of traceability and chain of custody to ensure compliance for example exploring how information from the HWP category in the LULUCF Regulation could be used
343,Enabling and supply Do enabling activities by default need to arise from a sectorsupply that is taxonomy eligiblecompliant in the context of significant contribution For example if wood used in construction of a building is recognised as enabling the source of the wood would need to be taxonomy aligned within the forest sector
344,GHG emissions Regarding enabling activities within the manufacturing sector no criteria on the GHG emissions from manufacturing are given because the benefits these lead to are considered to outweigh their emissions For Forestry this would be consistent with the current IPCC Guidelines Emissions are attributed at the point of harvest and thus in the forest sector However the largescale adoption of wood energy or wood material use could lead to an increased drain on the existing forest carbon sink  and may thus warrant safeguards
345,Multiple enablers The end use of wood is highly varied with both different fractions of the wood used in different resource streams and different products or end uses generated at different stages Figure 7 How and at what point in the wood flow would greening by be defined or it should be counted at each point when it substitutes nonrenewable resources
346,Despite the potential challenges to the Taxonomy for including a more holistic approach to the use of wood products in the wider economy there are a number of cases where operators have been able to develop approaches to tracking or estimating the substation effects and benefits of forest products in the wider economy These demonstrate proof of concept for a wider applicability of the forest Taxonomy than focussing only on the management of forests up to the forest gate
347,The TEG has received various documents in this regard including information provided by Stora Enso and SCA a Swedish publicly listed forest products company  both demonstrate the added value in climate terms of forest products in the overall economy through substitution effects The point of contention within the forest sector is that the EUs accounting of the climate benefits from forestry are not
348,fully attributed in the EUs GHG accounts to forestry as a sector ie the substitution effects are not attributed to the sector only the emissions of logging They do however point out that in the UNFCCC accounts all the benefits are recognised but that substation would be recognised in a separate sector than forestry They go on in the report to demonstrate a feasible calculation approach for substitution benefits that could be applied by businesses that are collecting the necessary information Some elements of this approach would need to be further validated such as the specific calculation of the substitution effect itself  as this is based on a conversion factor for three product groups These may be accurate conservative or inaccurate  but what is clear is that they are not a direct measurement but an assumed substitution level This may be ok but worth recognising
349,Overall therefore it would seem possible for the forest industry or specific businesses to be able to calculate the substitution effect of forest products arising in the forest sector as defined in the Taxonomy but delivering substitution benefits in other economy sectors The question still remains to which NACE sector the benefits arising from the use of wood should be attributed The logic of the taxonomy overall suggests that this should still be in the sector that takes the raw material and processes it into something which will deliver substitution or utilises that material or energy in substitute for another It would seem inappropriate to recognise the felling of trees ie the provision of the raw material as an enabling activity per se It is recognised however that forestproducts arise from a renewable resource rather than the finite resources of the extractive industries
350,Within the manufacturing TEG the Taxonomy already recognises enabling activities These are recognised on the basis of the principal of The manufacture of low carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy including private households is eligible It is therefore the production of something that would lead to substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors In this context components of renewable energy infrastructure are cited amongst others The line between the manufacture of an essential product for decarbonisation and substantial mitigation is clear Forest products are slightly different Wood materials and energy are not necessarily essential components of lowcarbon technology in that a house or furniture is not necessarily lowcarbon if it is made from wood The key identifying feature for wood products is one of substitution whether another lowercarbon product could be used or whether there are other forms of energy or demand reduction that would be more carbon beneficial Therefore the logical link for greening by of the forest sector would need to be able to demonstrate something like the following criteria
351,In light of the design of the overall Taxonomy activity based and the fact that the substitution effect can only be judged in an enduse sector ie at the product level it is challenging to produce a greening by approach that can be implemented through the forest Taxonomy alone As such it is proposed that the greening of through the use of forest products is addressed through those sectors that utilise those forest products ie end use or intermediary sectors such as manufacturing or buildings Specific recommendations to other Taxonomy sectors Buildings and Manufacturing are made in the preamble to the forest Taxonomy and not repeated here These can be summarised as follows
352,material with climate mitigation benefits and should be considered with priority for use in the economy This must be accompanied by robust DNSH criteria to ensure that the demand for forest products does not lead to impacts on the forest resources The future Taxonomy should ensure that wood used in other sectors to deliver substantial contribution to mitigation is also compliant with the forest Taxonomy
353,112 This is a nonexhaustive list of practices that could be used keeping in mind that all carbon pools identified here need to be addressed Applicants can develop further practices if meeting the requirements of the Category Types of practices always have to be understood depending on the local conditions temperature rainfall soil altitude species etc
354,Rationale Enhance structural stability against disturbances due to optimal crown and stem architecture that minimize the impact of disturbances storms pest outbreaks disturbances damage and associated carbon losses Support carbon stock andor carbon sequestration increase alone or in combination with forest resilience
355,Promote natural regeneration when in line with ecological conditions and stands requirements120 and adopt artificial regeneration only in cases of proved unsuccessful site spread on natural regeneration MF
356,varieties ecotypes of trees that adequately provide the best adaptation to the site and resilience to climate change natural disasters and the biotic pedologic and hydrologic condition of the area concerned as well as to the potential invasive character of the species under local conditions current and projected climate change
357,Rationale Increase the amount of standing and ground deadwood Approaches such as limited or nonintervention management and conservation forestry are associated with high carbon stocks given that more biomass is left in the forest rotation lengths are typically increased compared to conventional approaches while nonproductive ecosystem services are optimized
358,Agriculture is the management of the natural environment plants and animals to produce and process food feed fibre fuel and other products As a sector it plays a central role in climate change sustainable development and food security It is projected that by 2050 the global population will increase to 10 billion resulting in a 50 increase in the demand for food However even at present the food supply chain contributes 1929 of global greenhouse gas GHG emissions the majority of which for most supply chains occurs at the farm level 8090 In the EU 10 of GHG emissions are attributed to agriculture124 This alone presents opportunities for significant climate change mitigation However agriculture differs from other sectors when considering climate change mitigation as it can act as both a source and a sink for GHG emissions Soil carbon and biomass trees shrubs and grasslands are also relevant as major pools of carbon For this reason agriculture has the potential to be a net positive sector from an emissions perspective At the same time agricultural productivity is simultaneously vulnerable to climate change including but not limited to heat stress drought flooding changes in seasonality and extreme weather events and central to supporting adaptation and resilience through its provision of ecosystem services and income for billions of households worldwide
359,In addition mixed farming where combinations of the above activities are carried out on a farm holding can be addressed via the application of the relevant thresholds and criteria from these same three activities For the purpose of the Taxonomy mixed farming involves any operation with both livestock and crop production Crops grown in mixed farming can be grown either to feed livestock or for separate sale as a cash crop In assessing mixed farming operations cropland production should be screened using criteria for growing of nonperennials eg if vineyards or orchards are included or perennial crops eg if a farm grows cereals Livestock production should be assessed according to the animal production criteria It is important to note that recoupling of crops and livestock can lead to greater resource efficiency and reduced reliance on synthetic inputs thus improving climate and environmental
360,performance125 At the same time if accompanied by productivity improvement on existing agricultural lands mixed farming reduces the expansion pressures of agriculture into non cultivatedused land The recoupling of crop and livestock production is a systemic change which is beneficial and feasible in many contexts but it is not a mandatory requirement of the Taxonomy
361,As noted above agriculture can act as both a source and a sink for GHG emissions However it may not be possible to reach net negative emissions in every instance of agricultural activity or on every farm particularly those that are specialised in nature andor have low carbon stocking capacity Therefore the Taxonomy does not require the demonstration of net negative emissions at the activity or farm level but instead requires that the following three criteria must all be met for agricultural activities to be recognised as delivering substantial contributions to mitigation
362,The lack of deep GHG reporting datasets from which to establish best performance benchmarks coupled with the lack of emissions budgets or sequestration targets for the agricultural sector at either the EU or global level meant it was not possible to set robust absolute GHG thresholds for either criteria 1 or 2 Furthermore given the high degree of heterogeneity across the agricultural sector in terms of production system crop or livestock type farm size environmental and biophysical conditions etc it was felt to be inappropriate to do so
363,However requiring a relative GHG improvement compared to an ownfarm counterfactual is workable within this context of high heterogeneity For criteria 1 emissions reductions targets as a percentage of that counterfactual have been established using studies of the emissions reductions needed across the agricultural sector as whole over time For criteria 2 recognising that carbon stocking potential is highly variable across different land parcels but that carbon sequestration represents a large mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector a simpler requirement has been set  simply that carbon stocks are increased over a 20year period  which recognises that preventing ongoing carbon losses and increasing sequestration is viable to make a substantial contribution in this case It is noted however that the studies on emissions reduction paths are limited in number and therefore the criteria would benefit from greater clarity on the precise transition needed in the agriculture sector to contribute to a netzero economy in 2050
364,In addition recognising that relative GHG improvement targets are a fairly blunt instrument and require farm level GHG accounting which is not yet widespread an additional alternative approach is proposed Namely demonstration of the deployment of a specified bundle of land and if appropriate animal management practices across the production area From a review of the scientific literature these practices have been selected because they deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty
365,across a range of biophysical and farming conditions They should therefore be widely applicable and provide a more directly communicable approach to farmers although this would benefit from testing with key stakeholders globally including small and largescale farmers It will of course be necessary to regularly review this list of practices to integrate new advances in scientific knowledge
366,To maximise usability it is left open to the user whether they demonstrate i emissions reductions and increased sequestration directly or alternatively ii the deployment of the specified bundle of practices that have been deemed to represent a substantial contribution to mitigation Whichever approach is taken three yearly audits are required to demonstrate ongoing compliance with the criteria and thresholds This is to address the multiyear timeframes over which emissions reductions and carbon stocking can occur and acknowledges the risks to the permanence of carbon stocks The establishment of a pool of proxy indicators for compliance with these Criteria such as vetted and approved existing standards certification schemes carbon credit schemes and similar would greatly facilitate uptake of and disclosure against the Criteria
367,It is noted that besides supplying food and feed agriculture has the potential to and increasingly does supply biomass to be used as raw materials for the bioeconomy including textiles biobased materials for industry construction and packaging and bioenergy Biomaterials can have longer lifecycles than food and feed products and therefore can contribute to longerterm removal and sequestration of carbon Bioenergy can displace emissions from burning fossil fuels Agricultural production can therefore enable mitigation through other economic activities
368,The criteria presented here focus on the substantial mitigation that can be realised in the way these crops and resources are produced regardless of their end use They do not take into account any contribution that agricultural products can make to mitigation via the bioeconomy The Platform is asked to consider this aspect further to determine whether and under what circumstances these or alternative criteria for some agricultural production or producers might be appropriate in light of potential substantial contributions they can enable in downstream economic activities that are part of the bioeconomy
369,For clarification the recast Renewable Energy Directive RED II includes a number of sustainability requirements relating to the production of the feedstock used to produce bioenergy and these agricultural criteria are consistent with those requirements which can be applied across agricultural producers for their production of food bioenergy and biomaterials for various supply chains
370,These criteria also take guidance from and look to build on the cross compliance measures of the Common Agricultural Policy CAP and in particular the current proposals for the post2020 CAP per Annex III of COM2018392126
371,As a general principle the working group has aimed to ensure that the do no significant harm criteria in particular are aligned with the conditionality requirements that is the criteria that farmers must meet to become eligible for CAP subsidies The substantial contribution criteria go beyond these requirements as this was felt to be necessary to meet the scale of impact required to count as a substantial contribution The working group focussed on the post2020 CAP rather than the current CAP to future proof as much as possible these criteria Efforts have been made to cross reference these criteria to the post2020 CAP but the working group is cognisant that the post2020 CAP has not been adopted at this time and the Commission and subsequently the Platform on Sustainable Finance the Platform is requested to review the provisions of the post 2020 CAP when finalised and consider whether any changes would need to be made to these Criteria based on that
372,The interrelated nature of land management decisions and the impact on soil water biodiversity and carbon cycles means that the management of agricultural land for one objective of the Taxonomy eg climate mitigation will have an impact on other objectives of the Taxonomy eg protection of healthy ecosystems The Taxonomy is set up to ensure that for economic activities that are compliant with the Taxonomy a substantial contribution to mitigation in the agriculture sector does not come at the expense of significant harm to the other five environmental objectives However the interrelated nature of these environmental goals actually offers the opportunity to develop substantial mitigation approaches that not only do no harm to other Taxonomy objectives but also deliver or enable positive contributions to other Taxonomy objectives
373,For these reasons climate mitigation cannot should not and has not been considered in isolation from the other five environmental objectives of the Taxonomy Many of the measures included in the best practice tables for substantial contribution to mitigation criteria are agroecological practices or nature based land management activities eg crop rotation planting hedges which are winwin or noregret measures While they contribute substantially to climate mitigation they also have significant benefits for soil health biodiversity resource efficiency and water protection and thereby increase resilience against climatic extremes In other cases the synergies with other objectives need to be more carefully pursued and considerations made that are often contextspecific In particular with respect to livestock production synergies with sustainability objectives has required careful consideration and balancing productivity  intensity of production with increasing biodiversity value and improving water quality
374,The proposed criteria for agricultural production activities have been developed on the basis of enabling systemic transition over time This has in part been pursued so as to prevent system lockin whereby an immediate action for mitigation prevents or closes down future options for change that could deliver greater mitigation benefits in the sector For example the investment in activities that seek to improve the GHG performance of the livestock sector should not prevent more systemic changes in the sector through for example greater integration of livestock and crop production mixed farming or overall reduction in livestock production Another example can be taken from the perspective of the use and production of biofuels for the transport sector Whilst more sustainable liquid biofuels have allowed GHG emission reductions from transport energy they perpetuate the use of internal combustion engines in a mitigation development trajectory that may seek more substantial changes such as electrification of vehicles or modal shift
375,The TEG thanks all respondents who provided feedback to help improve the agriculture criteria for the Taxonomy The working group has evaluated the feedback and used the feedback in developing this report The following brief summary highlights the key feedback received and the response to it
376,criteria based on for example agroecological principles This approach was considered by the working group but was felt to be too openended to enable a set of criteria to be applied consistently by all users leading to a high risk of significant variation in levels of performance  However it is the view of the TEG that the criteria and specifically the best practices detailed here align with those principles and allow sufficient flexibility in their application to meet a variety of user circumstances while at the same time requiring a consistent level of performance across users
377,efforts have been made to reference to existing EU regulation that aligns with these criteria where it exists This is particularly the case for the do no significant harm criteria As noted above however that a number of these criteria relating to a substantial contribution to mitigation are consistent with but go beyond existing regulation
378,reviewed and considered in depth and changes made to the criteria accordingly following expert consultation This includes but is not limited to addressing emissions embedded in livestock feed and reconsidering the best practice relating to tillage
379,under the environmental goals of the Taxonomy at this time and therefore were not within the Agricultural Working Groups remit However a recommendation has been made to the Platform to integrate criteria addressing these factors at the earliest possible date
380,with these criteria This challenge is recognised by the working group To assist in addressing this the working group has requested that the Platform work with existing agricultural standards certification schemes carbon schemes and others to map consistency of requirements between those schemes and these criteria with the aim of establishing a pool of proxy indicators that can be taken as evidence of compliance with these criteria

382,There are 105 million farms in the EU using 173 million hectares ha of land for agricultural production about 39 of the EUs total land area In 2016 one quarter 251 of these farms are specialist livestock farms and just over half 525 are specialist crop farms the rest are composed of mixed farming 211128
383,Agriculture contributed 12 to the EUs GDP in 2017 even without considering its importance as the key building block for the downstream food and beverages processing industry It employs 97 million people just over 4 of the working population but these statistics vary significantly by country In Romania for example nearly a quarter of the working population work in agriculture and numbers are also high in Bulgaria Greece and Poland
384,Given the heterogeneity of agriculture it is challenging to establish a set of one size fits all criteria This point was raised in the public consultation feedback However it is the view of the TEG that these criteria are globally relevant for low carbon agriculture and with the inbuilt flexibility on options for demonstrating compliance they can be applied globally To assist with this the criteria are not tied to specific EU regulations though crossreference is made where appropriate to those regulations to assist EU users
385,Taking land completely out of agricultural production for the purposes of restoring or re establishing natural habitats particularly peatland and other carbon rich landscapes or integrating structural elements such as hedges buffer strips woody landscape features into agricultural land There are a number of known benefits such practices including increased carbon sequestration reduced soil erosion and nutrient loss and via its positive impact on biodiversity support pollination and pest control The challenge faced when considering whether a land out of production andor integration of structural elements practice should be required is setting an ambitious but implementable target Relevant questions are what proportion of land should be covered how should it be covered how would this be balanced with other objectives such as food production and how could permanence be ensured Further given the high co benefits and interrelations of such practice across mitigation biodiversity and general ecosystem health it is also debatable whether such practices most appropriately fits under substantial contribution to mitigation or substantial contribution to healthy ecosystems The
386,numbers and increasing legume production as an alternative source of protein with a corresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities At this time while livestock production and in particular ruminant livestock production beef lamb and dairy is a significant source of emissions in the agriculture sector it is included in the Taxonomy due to the significant shortterm mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestock management and because it is not yet clear what appropriate transition pathways are for livestock production In the interim it is appropriate to maximise the significant mitigation potential here noting the point made above that the best practices for livestock production do not prevent or close down further opportunities that might deliver greater mitigation opportunities in the sector However it is noted that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasing beyond a certain point and to move towards netzero targets by midcentury reduced emissions intensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumption patterns and overall reduced percapita consumption of livestock products especially certain beef lamb and dairy products129
387,This implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste as well as structural transformations in the agricultural sector Significant and coordinated policy efforts will be required to manage both consumer behavioural changes and to incentivise and manage structural change in the agrifood supply chain Future Taxonomy updates should however consider what rates of meat consumption andor practices for production are compatible with a zerocarbon economy
388,recognised as making a substantial contribution to climate mitigation at the level of the economic activity as a whole They can also be a significant portion of lending portfolios for some investors and so it is essential to develop appropriate criteria for them These measures or actions might include addressing energy or resource efficiency or land management through
389,129 There is consensus in the scientific community that climate neutrality requires dietary shifts which will also have significant public health benefits For example in the EU energy and protein intake levels are higher than recommended  for protein by as high as 70 per capita compared to WHO guidelines
390,The Platform is asked to consider how these and any other additional actions which deliver significant mitigation might be identified and evaluated and how these can be incorporated into the Taxonomy This includes determining a rule set to define what counts as significant mitigation from individual actions which may be consistent with similar rule sets across other economic activities or common across agricultural activities only or specific to individual agricultural activities
391,It is recommended that the Platform also look further into the addressing the complex interactions within agricultural production systems between the six environmental goals of the Taxonomy potential maximise synergies and cobenefits across the 6 environmental goals of the Taxonomy Specifically
392,The proposed Taxonomy criteria and practices for agriculture have been developed on the basis of enabling systemic change rather than focusing on individual fixes to the mitigation challenge The proposed practices consider implications beyond mitigation alone and seek where possible to support contribution to the wider environmental and climate adaptation objectives of the Taxonomy Regulation This work should be developed further The Platform should draw on existing and emerging evidence to consider further not just how substantial mitigation can be pursued without causing significant harm to other objectives but rather to pursue approaches that further optimize synergies and minimize tradeoffs between significant contribution to mitigation adaptation and biodiversity water and soil management This also includes improved consideration of how the benefits of mixed farming systems can better be captured in the Taxonomy
393,In addition livestock production comprises a broad range of practices including intensive and landless operations which can have particular environmental impacts beyond GHG emissions There were insufficient resources to analyse the current evidence base in depth in order to allow for a differentiated treatment of different forms of livestock production from a DNSH angle and it is recommended that the Platform look into this further
394,sector are currently not part of the DNSH criteria as they do not fall under the environmental goals prioritised at this time the stakeholder consultation as well as available research130 shows that these are significant societal expectations associated with livestock production131 As such a recommendation to the Platform is that criteria addressing animal welfare and health are integrated at the earliest possible date
395,130 Eg httpwwwrisefoundationeuimagesfiles20182018_RISE_LIVESTOCK_FULLpdf Whatever level of EU livestock production now and in the future it is essential that continued progress is made on four fronts improving resource efficiency reducing leakages into the environment increasing the health status and welfare of farmed animals and minimising the use of antibiotics
396,practices set out in the Taxonomy so as to realise synergies and avoid tradeoffs between objectives This would lay the groundwork for the Taxonomy as it evolves from DNSH to substantial contribution across all environmental objectives The platform is asked to consider two elements in this regard
397,regarding the applicability of each best practice listed in that localised context Whilst most best practices are generic in nature and set out the main approaches to delivering a substantial contribution to mitigation in agriculture the global reach of the Taxonomy naturally means that some practices in temperate regions may not be as applicable in subtropical areas etc
398,implementing the practices for substantial mitigation to do so in a way that benefits other environmental objectives and or simultaneously ensures no significant harm to other environmental objectives For example the sowing of catch and cover crops is likely to deliver significant contribution to water quality objectives by stabilising soils in periods of high runoff preventing silting and the movement of nutrients to water bodies Advice could be framed around the location within a farm where such practices would deliver particular benefits to water quality such as in high nutrient load areas on slopes and areas adjacent to water bodies To assist with this the TEG has included indictors in the best practice tables to identify which best practices have potential cobenefits with the other environmental goals of the Taxonomy
399,o A large number of carbon audit tools are available at present although there is variation in the coverage and robustness of these tools A recent review132 conducted in Scotland identified three tools deemed technically very suitable for farmlevel carbon audits in the Scottish context enabling sufficient robustness comprehensiveness and clarity of documentation Cool Farm Tool133 Scottish AgRE Calculator134 and JRC Carbon calculator135 At least the Cool Farm Tool and JRC Carbon Calculator are also more broadly applicable in the EU The FAOExact tool might also be appropriate to use It would be valuable if the Platform could provide guidance on appropriate tools for demonstrating compliance and support further development of the existing tools to address capacity building and compliance checking needs associated with a transition to lowcarbon farming

401,standards carbon credit schemes standards certification schemes or similar could be used as proxy indicators for compliance with these criteria and thresholds subject to meeting the same performance outcomes This includes engaging to align those standards or certification schemes if needed The adoption of such proxy indicators would help substantially in the costeffective demonstration of compliance with these criteria and thresholds
402,o Likewise efforts have been made to cross reference these criteria to the post2020 CAP for EU users This is a work in progress made complicated by the fact that the post2020 CAP has not been adopted at this time The Platform is therefore requested to review the provisions of the post 2020 CAP when finalised and consider whether any changes would need to be made to these Criteria based on that
403,o As currently proposed in the main the Criteria apply equally to and do not distinguish between smaller and large scale farms This seems appropriate in terms of seeking to address emissions reductions and sequestration in farms of all sizes to maximise aggregate impact recognising that small farms can be some of the most inefficient and emitting and large firms can be some of the most efficient per unit of output and vice versa However the Platform is asked to consider whether differences should be made in terms of the requirements to demonstrate compliance recognising the higher transaction cost impacts for smaller scale farmers
404,applicability based on input from TEG members and expert advisers with global expertise and experience However additional global consultation will be needed to confirm the appropriateness of these proposals for crop and livestock production around the world
405,in the way these crops and resources are produced regardless of their end use They do not take into account any contribution that agricultural products can make to mitigation via the bioeconomy The Platform is asked to consider this aspect further to determine whether and under what circumstances alternative criteria for some agricultural production or producers might be appropriate in light of potential substantial contributions they can enable in downstream economic activities that are part of the bioeconomy
406,Noting the following exception For soils specifically where it can be demonstrated that saturation levels have been reached no further increase in carbon content is expected In this case existing levels should be maintained
407,136 This requirement is taken from RED II Article 29 paragraphs 4 and 5 It is be applied to all perennial crop production whether for biofuels bioliquids or biomass or for food or feed uses The intention is per RED II namely to ensure high carbon stock land is not converted for the purposes for agricultural production
408,137 Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that when the methodology of part C of Annex V of RED II is applied the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled
409,table below All essential practices will need to be deployed except where particular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding
410,In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use see below for relevant GHG categories If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support this practice may be omitted in the first instance The assessment however becomes mandatory within a five year period The assessment is a selfassessment using an appropriate tool no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required
411,it will be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed  taking into account crop husbandry requirements farm pedoclimatic conditions  and their coverage on the farm To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decisionsupport tools
412,thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm see below for relevant GHG categories It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction carbon sequestration This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan
413,financed is less than 20 years to show broad compliance with the requirement for carbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new younger
414,stage crops with a potential fallow restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions With this in mind the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations
415,In the case of force majeure emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in noncompliance with these criteria
416,Prevent soil compaction frequency and timing of field operations should be planned to avoid traffic on wet soil tillage operation should be avoided or strongly reduced on wet soils stock density should be reduced to avoid compaction especially on wet soils
417,Nutrient management plan to optimize fertilization and improve nitrogen use efficiency The plan should be based on soil testing estimating of crops nutrient requirements recording of nutrient applications considering field characteristics and soil type estimating soil nitrogen supply and
418,In addition it is required that a low emission N application technology is used eg slurry injection incorporating manure in the soil within 2 hours of spreading and fertilizer spreaders which have low coefficient of variation synthetic fertilizer and farmyard manure eg placing N in the soil via injection combined with calibration of spreaders
419,Where energy emissions represent greater than 20 of total emissions from nonperennial crop production activity these emissions should be reduced appropriately for the term of the investment in line with the trajectory outlined on P11 ie by at least 10 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 5 year investment period 20 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 10 year investment period to 2030 and 30 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 20 year investment period  with prorata adjustments for investments of intermediate durations
420,An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation consistent with the underlying goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050
421,In the context of agriculture NetZero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero they can be compensated for through increased removals through carbon sequestration on farmed land The discussion about the scale at which netzero should and could be
422,met solely in agriculture remains open It may not be possible to reach netzero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases In other cases it may be more feasible At the aggregate level it may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas would struggle to reach netzero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country This raises the question as to the extent to which a given farm or aggregation of farms could reach netzero and the extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions sequestration from other farms or other sectors
423,Furthermore one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a whole is to switch from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities for example by reducing cattle numbers and increasing legume production as an alternative source of protein with a corresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities These criteria and thresholds which focus specifically on emissions within the perennial crop production activity cannot address this type of mitigation action
424,There is significant potential to reduce emissions maintain carbon sinks and increase sequestration through good practices in perennial cropland management Each of these needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a net zero carbon economy Doing so will ensure each instance of perennial cropland management maximises its contribution  this rationale drove the principles set out above
425,There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds eg gCO2e ha or gCO2e unit of production for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture Even if such information existed at the aggregate level translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice
426,However setting relative GHG thresholds ie  change in gCO2e is possible where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation Therefore it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly Furthermore to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold GHG accounting at farm level is necessary However this is not yet mainstream despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches
427,The proposals therefore allow for a different approach namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in agriculture This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor and there are existing mechanisms to do so such as under the CAP It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will additional investment finance to do so it also allows for the recognition of farms and associated assets
428,Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources enteric fermentation 429 0186 GtCO2e management of agricultural soils 38 0165 GtCO2e and manure management 154 0067 GtCO2e 2014 figures Mitigation potential therefore predominantly involves reductions in nonCO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU with CO2 from onfarm energy use being a minor component covering only 013 of total EU28ISL agriculture emissions in 2014 The largest share of the EUs agricultural non CO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide N2O and methane CH4 Nitrous oxide accounts for 58 of nonCO2 emissions from agriculture largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils as well as grazing animals with methane accounting for the remaining 42 largely from livestock and rice cultivation In some cases GHG emission from energy traction heating cooling irrigation can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than 20 of farm emissions these should be reduced by 20 through efficiency and energy source requirements
429,Rationale for the selection of practices Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible mitigation practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration in perennial cropland management
430,For the purpose of establishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of perennial cropland delivers substantial mitigation individual management practices were identified for which 1 there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives and 2 the scale certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated for example Smith et al 2008140 Paustian et al 2016141 Kay et al 2019142
431,These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so as to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production  outcomes critical for the delivery of substantial mitigation  and or reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture and also do not risk leakage effects They also do not risk negative ancillary effects nor are in conflict with legislation
432,Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and also indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial mitigation ie an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally sustainable should be pursued Paustian et al 2016 The literature however provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activitybased mitigation potential into individual farmlevel mitigation potential ie what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation Therefore TEG expert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied together for perennial cropland management to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level
433,The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that deployed collectively should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level It is noted that given heterogeneity of farms deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions impacts farm to farm but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives For example buffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and runoff are to be placed next to water courses and ditches etc Therefore some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value
434,One best practice the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced emissions or increased sequestration The rationale for including this practice is to raise awareness of where the main emission sources are on a farm holding what opportunities exist to reduce those emissions and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved including through opportunities for carbon sinks and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action In this spirit no verification or audit of the assessment is required to fulfil this best practice requirement This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit both of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds The assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop livestock production as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support this practice may be omitted in the first instance The assessment however becomes mandatory within a five year period
435,Substantial in the context of substantial mitigation falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net  negative where removals exceed emissions netzero where removals balance with emissions to varying degrees of emission reductions With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or perennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach and thus any level of substantial should be consistent in the global context
436,A review by Wollenberg et al 2016143 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between 09  14 GtCO2e in 2030 to meet the 2 C target 1 GtCO2e in 2030 This was selected as an approximate target These figures relate primarily to nonCO2 emissions and are an annualized not cumulative goal The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 615778 GtCO2e yr1 for agriculture in 2030 The goal represents an 1118 reduction relative to the scenarios respective 2030 business as usual baselines144 As these figures represent nonCO2 emissions they implicitly do not recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20 over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has been proposed as significant contribution in the context of the Taxonomy This is supported by work from Frank et al 2018145 and The IPCCs fourth assessment report Smith et al 2007146
437,In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture the work by Wollenberg et al 2016 calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to 2100 The emissions curve level of emissions over time increases and decreases at different points relative to existing efforts projected changes in external factors etc The average reduction figure needed over this whole timeframe is 28 emission reductions compared to the baseline As we move towards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases and this implications for any threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger approximately a doubling Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear between the years for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20 reduction by 2030 and 40 reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies implementation and communication
438,The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture However establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation effectiveness as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was not in place For simplicity the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved in 10 yearstime and assess this against the target reduction
439,The threshold metric for emissions reduction is gCO2e and not an emissions intensity metric such as gCO2e unit of production as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions intensity eg through energy or resource efficiency while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall  the overall goal
440,143 Wollenberg E Richards M Smith P Havlik P Obersteiner M Tubiello F N  Campbell B M 2016 Reducing emissions from agriculture to meet the 2C target Global Change Biology 22 38593864 doi101111gcb13340
441,146 Smith P et al 2007 Agriculture in Climate Change 2007 Mitigation Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Cambridge University Press New York
442,Setting a universal or global absolute threshold in terms of tC ha for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential  which is very context specific Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in line with a universal absolute threshold Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site is not possible as at present is it is impractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential ie saturation point of a specific area Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type and therefore are not truly context specific
443,Furthermore even defining a specific  of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting the relative threshold for reducing emissions Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of emissions at a given point therefore a 20 reduction over 10 years for example can be expected to deliver a substantial contribution from an underperforming farm resulting in high overall emission reductions However the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on agricultural land in a 15 or 2C climate stabilisation target scenario as this is relative to the level of emissions from that same land if one is pursuing a netzero approach or the level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy It is however recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global scale while emission savings of nonCO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing intensive production system Smith et al 2007 estimate that 89 of the technical potential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration iein reducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management including cropland management grazing land management restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands
444,The proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing carbon stocks specifically the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20year period A 20 year period for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturation period Where the remaining lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new younger stage crops with a potential fallow restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions With this in mind the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations
445,A cutoff date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the operation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types This provides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated for this criterion
446,3year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being delivered in practice and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators This compliance checking is required for management practice checking C stock change and GHG reductions
447,To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decisionsupport tools Advisory support will likely be required in the process of preparing the plan and may also be required to ensure adequate implementation of the plan
448,Note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned
449,Identify and manage risks related to water quality andor water consumption at the appropriate level Ensure that water useconservation management plans developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders have been developed and implemented
450,148 Consistent with GAEC 5 of Annex III of COM2018392 The aim is to provide farmers with a digital tool that helps them optimize the use of nutrients on their farm leading to environmental and agronomic benefits
451,Activities ensure that nutrients fertilisers and plant protection products eg pesticides and herbicides are targeted in their application in time and area treated and are delivered at appropriate levels with preference to sustainable biological physical or other nonchemical methods if possible and with appropriate equipment and techniques to reduce risk and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment eg water and air pollution and the loss of excess nutrients151
452,149 It is noted that the EU Circular Economy Strategy and many of the actions from the corresponding actions plans have relevance to agriculture that may provide guidance here eg proposing legislation setting minimum requirements for reused water for agricultural irrigation new Fertiliser Regulation introducing harmonised rules for organic fertilisers manufactured from secondary raw materials such as agricultural byproducts and biowastes

456,Noting the following exception For soils specifically where it can be demonstrated that saturation levels have been reached no further increase in carbon content is expected In this case existing levels should be maintained
457,156 This requirement is taken from RED II Article 29 paragraphs 4 and 5 It is be applied to all perennial crop production whether for biofuels bioliquids or biomass or for food or feed uses The intention is per RED II namely to ensure high carbon stock land is not converted for the purposes for agricultural production
458,157 Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that when the methodology of part C of Annex V of RED II is applied the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled
459,In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use see below for relevant GHG categories If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support this practice may be omitted in the first instance The assessment however becomes mandatory within a five year period The assessment is a self assessment using an appropriate tool no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required
460,necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed  taking into account crop husbandry requirements farm pedoclimatic conditions  and their coverage on the farm To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decisionsupport tools
461,To demonstrate compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds it will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm see below for relevant GHG categories It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction carbon sequestration This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan
462,Where the remaining lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years to show broad compliance with the requirement for carbon stocks to increase progressively over a 20 year period assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new younger stage crops with a potential fallow restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions With this in mind the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations
463,In the case of force majeure emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in noncompliance with these criteria
464,Sowing of covercatch crops using a locally appropriate species mixture with at least 1 legume and reducing bare soil to the point of having a living plant coverage index of at least 75 at farm level per year
465,Prevent soil compaction frequency and timing of field operations should be planned to avoid traffic on wet soil tillage operation should be avoided or strongly reduced on wet soils stock density should be reduced to avoid compaction especially on wet soils controlled traffic planning can be used For best longterm results drainage assessment and improvements needed to be carried out regularly
466,Nutrient management plan to optimize fertilization and improve nitrogen use efficiency The plan should be based on soil testing estimating of crops nutrient requirements recording of nutrient applications considering field characteristics and soil type estimating soil nitrogen supply and where applicable analysis of manure nutrient content prior to application
467,In addition it is required that a low emission N application technology is used eg slurry injection incorporating manure in the soil within 2 hours of spreading and fertilizer spreaders which have low coefficient of variation synthetic fertilizer and
468,Where energy emissions represent more than 20 of total emissions from nonperennial crop production activity these emissions should be appropriately for the term of the investment in line with the trajectory outlined on P11 ie by at least 10 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 5 year investment period 20 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 10 year investment period to 2030 and 30 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 20 year investment period  with prorata adjustments for investments of intermediate durations
469,An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation consistent with the overarching goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050
470,In the context of agriculture NetZero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero they can be compensated for through increased removals through carbon sequestration on farmed land The discussion about the scale at which netzero should and could be met solely in agriculture remains open It may not be possible to reach netzero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases In other cases it may be more feasible At the aggregate level it
471,may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas would struggle to reach netzero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country This raises the question as to the extent to which a given farm or aggregation of farms could reach netzero and the extent to which these farms could appropriate negative emissions sequestration from other farms or other sectors Furthermore one opportunity for emissions reductions in the agriculture sector as a whole is to switch from higher emitting activities to lower emitting activities for example by moving from conventional production using artificial fertiliser to organic farming with a corresponding consumption switch between agricultural commodities These criteria and thresholds which focus specifically on emissions within the nonperennial crop production activity cannot address this type of mitigation potential
472,There is significant potential to reduce emissions maintain carbon sinks and increase sequestration through good practices in nonperennial cropland management Each of these needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a netzero carbon economy Doing so will ensure each instance of nonperennial cropland management maximises its contribution  this rationale drove the principles set out above
473,There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds eg gCO2e ha or gCO2e unit of production for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture Even if such information existed at the aggregate level translating this to appropriate thresholds for implementation would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation
474,However setting relative GHG thresholds ie  change in gCO2e ha or  change in gCO2eunit of production is possible where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and if the farm is already delivering significant mitigation Therefore it is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X reduction in emissions than it is for a farm that currently performs relatively poorly Furthermore to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold GHG accounting at the farm level is necessary However this is not yet mainstream despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches
475,The proposals therefore allow for a different approach namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices which are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in agriculture This more qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor and there are existing mechanisms to do so such as under the CAP It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will require additional investment finance to do so it also allows for the recognition of farms and associated assets and equity that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG
476,Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources enteric fermentation 429 0186 GtCO2e management of agricultural soils 38 0165 GtCO2e and manure management 154 0067 GtCO2e 2014 figures Mitigation potential therefore predominantly involves reductions in nonCO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU with CO2 from onfarm energy use being a minor component covering only 013 of total EU28ISL agriculture emissions in 2014 The largest share of the EUs agricultural non CO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide N2O and methane CH4 Nitrous oxide accounts for 58 of nonCO2 emissions from agriculture largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils as well as grazing animals with methane accounting for the remaining 42 largely from livestock and rice cultivation In some cases GHG emission from energy traction heating cooling irrigation can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than 20 of farm emissions these should be reduced by 20 through efficiency and energy source requirements
477,In respect of nonperennial cropland production key sources of emissions are emissions associated with soil management and the application of fertilisers methane emissions from rice cultivation and avoided emissions embedded in crop waste
478,Rationale for the selection of practices Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible management practices available in the agricultural sector to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration in nonperennial cropland management For the purpose of establishing criteria and thresholds which identify when the economic activity of nonperennial cropland delivers substantial mitigation individual management practices were identified for which 1 there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives and 2 the scale certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated for example Smith et al 2008160 Paustian et al 2016161 Kay et al 2019162
479,These management practices have been demonstrated to improve soil health and soil productivity so as to secure agricultural yields and thus reduce the emission intensity of crop production  outcomes critical for the delivery of substantial mitigation The selected practices include reducing the carbon intensity of agriculture and also do not risk leakage effects They also do not risk negative ancillary
480,Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories of individual practices and also indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial mitigation ie an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally sustainable should be pursued Paustian et al 2016 The literature however provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activitybased mitigation potential into individual farmlevel mitigation potential ie what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation Therefore TEG expert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied together for nonperennial cropland management to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level
481,The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that deployed collectively should deliver substantial mitigation at farm level It is noted that given heterogeneity of farms deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions impacts farm to farm but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases
482,The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives For example buffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and runoff are to be placed next to water courses and ditches etc Therefore some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value
483,One best practice the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced emissions or increased sequestration The rationale for including this practice it to raise awareness of where the main emission sources are on a farm holding what opportunities exist and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved including through opportunities for carbon sinks and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action In this spirit no verification or audit of the assessment is required This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit both of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds The assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with crop livestock production as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support this practice may be omitted in the first instance The assessment however becomes mandatory within a five year period
484,Substantial in the context of substantial mitigation falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net  negative where removals exceed emissions netzero where removals balance with emissions to varying degrees of emission reductions With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or nonperennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach and thus any level of substantial should be consistent in the global context
485,A review by Wollenberg et al 2016163 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between 09  14 GtCO2e in 2030 to meet the 2 C target 1 GtCO2e in 2030 This was selected as an approximate target These figures relate primarily to nonCO2 emissions and are an annualized not cumulative goal The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 615778 GtCO2e yr1 for agriculture in 2030 The goal represents an 1118 reduction relative to the scenarios respective 2030 business as usual baselines164 As these figures represent nonCO2 emissions they implicitly do not recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20 over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has been proposed as significant contribution in the context of the Taxonomy This is supported by work from Frank et al 2018165 and The IPCCs fourth assessment report Smith et al 2007166
486,In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture the work by Wollenberg et al 2016 calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to 2100 The emissions curve level of emissions over time increases and decreases at different points relative to existing efforts projected changes in external factors etc The average reduction figure needed over this whole timeframe is 28 emission reductions compared to the baseline As we move towards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases and this implications for any threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger approximately a doubling Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear between the years for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20 reduction by 2030 and 40 reduction by 2050 as a linear trajectory of emission reductions also simplifies implementation and communication
487,The study determined these reductions against a business as usual BaU scenario for agriculture However establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation effectiveness as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was not in place For simplicity the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved over the period and assess this against the target reduction for that period
488,The threshold metric is gCO2e and not an intensity metric such as gCO2e unit of production as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by both those reducing emission intensity eg through efficiency while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall  the overall goal

491,Setting a universal or global absolute threshold in terms of tC ha for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential  which is very context specific Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in line with a universal absolute threshold Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site is not possible as at present is it is impractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential ie saturation point of a specific area Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type and therefore are not truly context specific
492,Furthermore even defining a specific  of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting the relative threshold for reducing emissions Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of emissions at a given point therefore a 20 reduction can be expected to deliver a substantial contribution from an underperforming farm resulting in high overall emission reductions However the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on agricultural land in a 15 or 2C climate stabilisation target scenario as this is relative to the level of emissions from that same land if one is pursuing a netzero approach or the level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy It is however recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global scale while emission savings of nonCO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing intensive production system Smith et al 2007 estimate that 89 of the technical potential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration iein reducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management including cropland management grazing land management restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands
493,The proposal is therefore to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing carbon stocks specifically the progressive increase of carbon stocks over a 20year period A 20 year period for C stock saturation maintenance is proposed in line with the IPCC 20 year soil C saturation period Where the remaining lifecycle of the crop production being financed is less than 20 years assurance should be sought on the likely replanting of crops to promote the permanence of carbon sequestration trends It is recognised that uprooting old crops and replacing with new younger stage crops with a potential fallow restoration period between will lead to a reduction in carbon stocks and some emissions With this in mind the objective is to ensure overall maintenance of carbon stocks and or upward trends in sequestration are sought over multiple rotations
494,A cutoff date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the operation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types This provides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated for this criterion
495,3year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being delivered in practice and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators This compliance checking is required for management practice checking C stock change and GHG reductions
496,To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decisionsupport tools Advisory support will likely be required in the process of preparing the plan and may also be required to ensure adequate implementation of the plan
497,Note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned
498,Identify and manage risks related to water quality andor water consumption at the appropriate level Ensure that water useconservation management plans developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders have been developed and implemented
499,168 Consistent with GAEC 5 of Annex III of COM2018392 The aim is to provide farmers with a digital tool that helps them optimize the use of nutrients on their farm leading to environmental and agronomic benefits
500,Activities ensure that nutrients fertilisers and plant protection products eg pesticides and herbicides are targeted in their application in time and area treated and are delivered at appropriate levels with preference to sustainable biological physical or other nonchemical methods if possible and with appropriate equipment and techniques to reduce risk and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment eg water and air pollution and the loss of excess nutrients 170
501,Activities do not lead to the conversion fragmentation or unsustainable intensification of highnaturevalue farmland wetlands forests or other areas of highbiodiversity value172 This includes highly biodiverse grassland spanning more than one hectare that is
502,ii nonnatural namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and that is speciesrich and not degraded and has been identified as being highly biodiverse by the relevant competent authority
503,169 It is noted that the EU Circular Economy Strategy and many of the actions from the corresponding actions plans have relevance to agriculture that may provide guidance here eg proposing legislation setting minimum requirements for reused water for agricultural irrigation new Fertiliser Regulation introducing harmonised rules for organic fertilisers manufactured from secondary raw materials such as agricultural byproducts and biowastes
504,170 See Directive 2009128EC on sustainable use of pesticides and the Nitrates Directive SMR 13 of CAP post 2020 will link the implementation of the pesticide directive with direct payments under cross compliance

506,Where activities involve the production of novel nonnative or invasive alien species their cultivation should be subject to an initial risk assessment and ongoing monitoring in order to ensure that sufficient safeguards are in place to prevent escape to the environment
507,Noting the following exception For soils specifically where it can be demonstrated that saturation levels have been reached no further increase in carbon content is expected In this case existing levels should be maintained
508,174 This requirement is taken from RED II Article 29 paragraphs 4 and 5 It is be applied to all perennial crop production whether for biofuels bioliquids or biomass or for food or feed uses The intention is per RED II namely to ensure high carbon stock land is not converted for the purposes for agricultural production

510,below All essential practices will need to be deployed except where particular practices can be demonstrated to be not applicable to that farm holding given the particular biophysical conditions at that farm holding
511,In respect of the essential practice relating to the GHG assessment this assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated with production as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use see below for relevant GHG categories If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support this practice may be omitted in the first instance The assessment however becomes mandatory within a five year period The assessment is a selfassessment using an appropriate tool no independent audit or verification of the GHG assessment is required
512,be necessary to establish a farm sustainability management plan which describes the management practices being deployed  taking into account crop husbandry requirements farm pedoclimatic conditions  and their coverage on the farm To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decisionsupport tools
513,175 Unless evidence is provided that the carbon stock of the area before and after conversion is such that when the methodology of part C of Annex V of RED II is applied the conditions laid down in paragraph 10 of Article 29 of RED II would be fulfilled
514,will be necessary to establish a Carbon stock and GHG emission baseline for the farm see below for relevant GHG categories It will be against such baseline data that emission reductions of Carbon increases can be measured A carbon audit is necessary in order to also assess where action is needed and this must be accompanied by a carbon management plan to set out the management practices that will deliver the GHG emissions reduction carbon sequestration This carbon management plan is part of the broader farm sustainability plan
515,Calculations of carbon stocks and GHG emissions levels should include the following though it is recognised that in practice the scope of GHG counted will be subject to the technical capabilities of the GHG accounting tools being used
516,In the case of force majeure emissions resulting from natural disturbance can be excluded from impacting on the achievement of the thresholds and will not affect the application of these requirements or result in noncompliance with these criteria
517,Better health planning and management develop a health management plan improve hygiene  supervision at parturition improve maternal nutrition in late gestation to increase offspring survival improve fertility management selection for improving both methane and ammonia emission efficiency
518,dietary fats nitrate 3NOP can reduce enteric CH4 emissions of ruminants They need to be administered by mixed into the feed and the dosage needs to be set accurately in order to avoid some potential negative health effects on the livestock It is usually not feasible to apply these for the periods when the livestock is grazing
519,Precision and multiphase feeding techniques where the nutrient requirements of groups of animals or individual animals are targeted in feed formulation This can reduce nitrogen excretion and subsequent N2O emissions from manure and also increase feed efficiency in general reducing the feed related upstream emissions
520,Cooling of liquid manure CH4 emissions from liquid manure increase with temperature The slurry can be stored at a lower ambient temperature by using animal houses where the manure is collected in an outside pit rather than in the house
521,176 This would require that where imported or boughtin from outside the region that it is drawn from certified feed supply chains For example the Round Table on Responsible Soy RTRS provides certification for production and for chain of custody traceability through the supply chain Other certification for other crops feedstocks standards exists
522,Covering and sealing slurry and farmyard manure storage to reduce gaseous losses of ammonia and related indirect N2O and also CH4 emissions A wide choice of technological solutions is available from short lifetime plastic film covers to retrofitted or purpose built rigid covers
523,Separating solids from slurry via mechanical or chemical ways the liquid part rich in N of the slurry and also digestate from AD can be separated from the solid part rich in phosphorous and volatile solids
524,Slurry acidification is achieved by adding strong acids to the slurry to achieve a pH of 4568  this reduces CH4 and NH3 emissions considerably There are three main types of technology based on the stage at which the acid is added to the slurry in the livestock house in the storage tank or before field application The slurry tank and the spreading equipment needs to be designed to withstand the acidic liquid and precautions particularly while handling the strong acids are needed to minimize the risk of accidents A better monitoring of the storage is also advisable to reduce the risk of slurry spillage to a minimum
525,Where energy emissions represent more than 20 of total emissions from livestock production activity these emissions should be reduced appropriately for the term of the investment in line with the trajectory outlined on P11 ie by at least 10 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 5 year investment period 20 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 10 year investment period to 2030 and 30 compared to a 2020 baseline for a 20 year investment period  with prorata adjustments for investments of intermediate durations
526,An overarching goal of the Taxonomy is to enable the screening of economic activities to determine whether or when they do or do not deliver substantial mitigation consistent with the underlying goal of a net zero carbon economy by 2050
527,In the context of agriculture NetZero is a means to ensure that even where GHG emissions cannot be reduced to zero they can be compensated for through increased removals through carbon sequestration on farmed land The discussion about the scale at which netzero should and could be met solely in agriculture remains open It may not be possible to reach netzero emissions on an individual farm holding in all cases In other cases it may be more feasible At the aggregate level it may be that some countries with concentrated production systems and small land areas would struggle to reach netzero emissions within the agriculture sector alone and within country This raises the question as to the extent to which a given farm or aggregation of farms could reach netzero and
528,The criteria proposed in the Taxonomy do not attempt to address this question directly and instead focus on ensuring that emissions are reduced and that removals increase at the economic activity NACE code level
529,While livestock production and in particular ruminant livestock production beef lamb dairy is a significant source of emissions in the agriculture sector it is included in the Taxonomy due to the significant shortterm mitigation potential associated with reducing emissions intensity in livestock management and in particular longlived greenhouse gases N20 CO2 through good practices on the farm In the short term emission reductions associated with improved nitrogen use efficiency and manure management are substantial with overall positive impacts on farm level economics Each of these needs to be addressed in order to ensure that agriculture as a whole delivers substantial mitigation and contributes its part to a net zero carbon economy Doing so ensures each instance of livestock management maximises its contribution  this rationale drove the principles set out above
530,However it is important to note that for absolute emissions from agriculture to continue decreasing beyond a certain point and to move towards netzero targets by midcentury reduced emissions intensity will need to be coupled as soon as possible with commensurate changes in consumption patterns and overall reduced percapita consumption of livestock products especially beef lamb and dairy products This implies both societal changes in terms of changing diets and reducing food waste as well as structural transformations in the agricultural sector Significant and coordinated policy efforts will be required to manage both behavioural changes on the side of consumers and to incentivise and manage structural change in the agrifood supply chain At this point the Taxonomy cannot address such shifts but can only point to significant shortterm potential associated with efficiency gains Future Taxonomy updates should however consider these aspects
531,There continues to be a relative paucity of information and data to set absolute thresholds eg gCO2e ha or gCO2e unit of production for agriculture that represent low carbon agriculture Even if such information existed at the aggregate level translating this to appropriate thresholds would remain challenging given the heterogeneity across farms and farming practice implementation
532,However setting relative GHG thresholds ie  change in gCO2e ha or  change in gCO2eunit of production is possible where these can be made relative to a counterfactual on the same farm or project Whilst this provides some quantitative means of assessing mitigation performance it is a relatively blunt mechanism as it does not take into account emissions reductions which might previously have been achieved and farm is already delivering significant mitigation Therefore is harder for a farm that already performs relatively well to deliver an additional X reduction in emissions than it is for a form that currently performs relatively poorly Furthermore to determine compliance with such a GHG threshold GHG accounting at farm level is necessary But this is not yet mainstream despite the existence of a range of tools and approaches
533,The proposals therefore allow for a different approach namely the demonstration of the deployment of specific bundles of management practices practices that are recognised as essential to delivering low carbon production in different types of agriculture This qualitative approach is relatively simple to monitor and there are existing mechanisms to do so such as under the CAP It also provides a more directly communicable approach to farmers and land managers who will implement such practices on the ground As this approach is applicable for those who have already established such practices as well as those that will additional investment finance to do so it also allows for the recognition of farms and associated assets and equity that are already high performers in terms of a low GHG footprint so avoids the problems associated with the relative GHG threshold as described above
534,Emission contributions from agriculture in the EU arise primarily from three sources enteric fermentation 429 0186 GtCO2e management of agricultural soils 38 0165 GtCO2e and manure management 154 0067 GtCO2e And they are predominantly from reductions in nonCO2 emissions as these form the majority of agriculture emissions in the EU with CO2 from onfarm energy use being a minor component covering only 013 of total EU28ISL agriculture emissions in 2014 The largest share of the EUs agricultural nonCO2 GHG emissions comes from the more potent nitrous oxide N2O and methane CH4 Nitrous oxide accounts for 58 of nonCO2 emissions from agriculture largely from fertiliser application and exposed soils as well as grazing animals with methane accounting for the remaining 42 largely from livestock and rice cultivation In some cases GHG emission from energy traction heating cooling irrigation can form a significant proportion of emissions arising from the farm The proposed best practices therefore include a provision for when GHG emissions from energy are greater than 20 of farm emissions these should be reduced by 20 through efficiency and energy source requirements
535,In relation to livestock management mitigation potential derives from improved animal health planning loweremission feeding strategies and reducing emissions from manure management and waste treatment Buckley et al 2015179 Chadwick et al 2011180 Miselbrook et al 2014181
536,Rationale for the selection of practices Scientific literature identifies a wide range of possible mitigation activities available in livestock production to address the different emissions and opportunities for sequestration

538,For the purpose of the Taxonomy individual management practices were identified for which 1 there is sufficient existing scientific knowledge and consensus on the mitigation effects and interactions with other environmental and food security objectives and 2 the scale certainty and consistency of mitigation effects is sufficiently demonstrated for example Smith et al 2008182 Paustian et al 2016183 Kay et al 2019184
539,The identified practices include activities that reduce the carbon intensity of agriculture and do not risk leakage effects and also do not risk negative ancillary effects or are in conflict with legislation in the EU These practices deliver substantial mitigation with relatively high certainty across a range of biophysical and farming conditions
540,Scientific literature provides insights on mitigation potential on categories or individual practices and also indicates that it is the combination of practices which are applied over large areas that leads to substantial mitigation ie an approach is required where all feasible mitigation practices which are environmentally sustainable should be pursued Paustian et al 2016 The literature however provides limited guidance on how to translate sectoral or activitybased mitigation potential into individual farmlevel mitigation potential ie what combination of practices should be applied together as a minimum at farm level in different conditions to deliver substantial mitigation Therefore TEG expert input was used to determine the minimum combination of practices which should be applied together for each NACE activity code to deliver substantial mitigation at farm level
541,The table below indicates the management practices selected as the bundle of essential practices that deployed collectively should deliver substantial mitigation from livestock production at farm level It is noted that given heterogeneity of farms deployment of the same bundle of practices may result in different emissions impacts farm to farm but overall it is expected that deployment of this bundle will deliver substantial mitigation in the majority of cases
542,The applicable area for management practices relates to where those practices could and should be deployed on a farm in order to meet their objectives For example buffer strips designed to prevent soil erosion and runoff are to be placed next to water courses and ditches etc Therefore some practices may only be deployed on a small area of the farm where they add value
543,One best practice the requirement to undertake a GHG assessment does not directly lead to reduced emissions or increased sequestration The rationale for including this practice it to raise awareness of where the main emission sources are on a farm holding what opportunities exist and thus where greatest mitigation impact could be achieved including through opportunities for carbon sinks and thereby improve the targeting of mitigation action In this spirit no verification or audit of the assessment is required This is different from the quantitative baseline assessment and carbon audit both of which are necessary when demonstrating compliance with the quantitative GHG thresholds The assessment should be done using tools that cover all relevant emissions on the farm associated
544,with crop livestock production as well as emissions associated with energy and fuel use If it can be demonstrated that no carbon assessment tool is currently accessible to farmers in a given location either because of language or lack of access to farm advisory support this practice may be omitted in the first instance The assessment however becomes mandatory within a five year period
545,Substantial in the context of substantial mitigation falls on a spectrum of mitigation potential from net  negative where removals exceed emissions netzero where removals balance with emissions to varying degrees of emission reductions With no EU or global baseline target for emission reductions from the agriculture sector as a whole or nonperennial crop production specifically the degree to which emission reductions and removals should be required becomes a question of ambition and need It is also noted that the Taxonomy has a global reach and thus any level of substantial should be consistent in the global context
546,A review by Wollenberg et al 2016185 suggests a total mitigation need from agriculture from between 09  14 GtCO2e in 2030 to meet the 2 C target 1 GtCO2e in 2030 This was selected as an approximate target These figures relate primarily to nonCO2 emissions and are an annualized not cumulative goal The target assumes an allowable emissions budget of 615778 GtCO2e yr1 for agriculture in 2030 The goal represents an 1118 reduction relative to the scenarios respective 2030 business as usual baselines186 As these figures represent nonCO2 emissions they implicitly do not recognise the role of potential carbon sequestration and its contribution to global mitigation goals As such a GHG emissions reduction threshold of 20 over the 10 year period from 2020 to 2030 has been proposed as significant contribution in the context of the Taxonomy This is supported by work from Frank et al 2018187 and The IPCCs fourth assessment report Smith et al 2007188
547,In terms of establishing a declining emissions trajectory for agriculture the work by Wollenberg et al 2016 calculates emission reduction needs based on a trajectory of emissions from 2010 through to 2100 The emissions curve level of emissions over time increases and decreases at different points relative to existing efforts projected changes in external factors etc The average reduction figure needed over this whole timeframe is 28 emission reductions compared to the baseline As we move towards 2040 and 2050 the level of emission reductions needed increases and this implications for any threshold set beyond the 2030 timeframe The reduction figure in 2050 would be larger approximately a doubling Although in the study the level of emission reductions needed is not linear between the years for simplicity a linear reduction is drawn between the two pegs of 20 reduction by
548,185 Wollenberg E Richards M Smith P Havlik P Obersteiner M Tubiello F N  Campbell B M 2016 Reducing emissions from agriculture to meet the 2C target Global Change Biology 22 38593864 doi101111gcb13340
549,188 Smith P et al 2007 Agriculture in Climate Change 2007 Mitigation Contribution of Working Group III to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Cambridge University Press New York
550,The study determined these reductions against a business as usual scenario for agriculture However establishing a BaU counterfactual level of emissions for each project or farm could limit implementation effectiveness as the BaU emissions would need to be calculated assuming the mitigation action was not in place For simplicity the proposed approach is therefore to simplify the requirement to compare emissions at the start of period with those achieved over the specified period and assess this against the target reduction
551,The threshold metric is gCO2e and not an emissions intensity metric such as gCO2e unit of production as this enables the Taxonomy to be applied by those reducing emissions intensity eg through efficiency improvements while also requiring them to reduce emissions overall  the overall goal
552,Setting a universal or global absolute threshold in terms of tC ha for carbon stocks is not a viable option given the variability of carbon sequestration and stocking potential  which is very context specific Those with low carbon stock potential will not be able to deliver substantial sequestration in line with a universal absolute threshold Even setting an absolute threshold linked to local conditions based on maximum carbon stocking potential at that site is not possible as at present is it is impractical to test and estimate the maximum sequestration potential ie saturation point of a specific area Such calculations currently use default values based on soil type and therefore are not truly context specific
553,Furthermore even defining a specific  of carbon increase required is more challenging than setting the relative threshold for reducing emissions Reducing emissions is always proportional to the level of emissions at a given point therefore a 20 reduction can be expected to deliver a substantial contribution from an underperforming farm resulting in high overall emission reductions However the premise is different when looking to increase sequestration on agricultural land as there is relatively little evidence and few studies that suggest what level of Carbon stock increase would be needed on agricultural land in a 15 or 2C climate stabilisation target scenario as this is relative to the level of emissions from that same land if one is pursuing a netzero approach or the level of carbon sequestration needed to offset other sectors of the economy It is however recognised that C sequestration represents the largest mitigation potential available to the agriculture sector at global scale while emission savings of nonCO2 emissions may be more important in the EU with a prevailing intensive production system Smith et al 2007 estimate that 89 of the technical potential of emission reductions in the sector to 2030 and 2050 lies in soil carbon sequestration iein reducing net CO2 emissions from farming practices and management including cropland management grazing land management restoration of cultivated organic soils and restoration of degraded lands
554,The proposal therefore is to require evidence of a positive direction of travel in terms of increasing carbon stocks specifically the progressive increase of carbon stocks confirmed at 3year intervals over a 20 year period
555,A cutoff date of 2008 for no conversion of high carbon stock land is chosen to be consistent with the operation of the Renewable Energy Directive sustainability criteria relative to these land types This provides a link with existing sustainability schemes through which compliance could be demonstrated for this criterion
556,3year compliance checking is proposed to ensure progress is being made and mitigation is being delivered in practice and also to reduce the burden necessary on operators This compliance checking is required for management practice checking C stock change and GHG reductions
557,To prepare the farm sustainability management plan a carbon calculator can be used or the plan can also be prepared using other nutrient decisionsupport tools Advisory support will likely be required in the process of preparing the plan and may also be required to ensure adequate implementation of the plan
558,The activity livestock production captures a distinct set of subactivities that would include intensive and extensive forms of livestock rearing as well as the management of permanent grassland These come with different key environmental aspects that need to be considered for investments in this sector summarised as follows
559,To note that areas of environmental risk are highly geographically variable Guidance should be sought from the relevant competent national or regional authority to identify areas or issues of importance and relevance within the area or project concerned
560,Identify and manage risks related to water quality andor water consumption at the appropriate level Ensure that water useconservation management plans developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders have been developed and implemented
561,Activities ensure that nutrients fertilisers and plant protection products eg pesticides and herbicides are targeted in their application in time and area treated and are delivered at appropriate levels with preference to sustainable biological physical or other nonchemical methods if possible to reduce risk and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment eg water and air pollution and the loss of excess nutrients through leaching volatilisation or oxidisation190
562,The use only of plant protection products with active substances that ensure high protection of human and animal health and the environment191Ensure emissions to air water and soil are within the BATAEL ranges  are prevented or reduced by using a combination of BAT techniques as set out in the BREF for the Intensive Rearing of Poultry or Pigs192 and by using similar emission reducing techniques for dairy farming
563,190 See Directive 2009128EC on sustainable use of pesticides and the Nitrates Directive SMR 13 of CAP post 2020 will link the implementation of the pesticide directive with direct payments under cross compliance
564,193 This threshold derives from the provisions set out under the Nitrates Directive 91676EC Council Directive 91676EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources In practice the threshold of 170kghayear has been implemented by Member States by setting limits on livestock density between 17  20 livestock units  ha Livestock unit is a reference unit which facilitates the aggregation of livestock from various species and age as per convention via the use of specific coefficients established on the basis of the nutritional or feed requirement of each type of animal see for example httpseceuropaeueurostatstatisticsexplainedindexphpGlossaryLivestock_unit_LSU
565,ii nonnatural namely grassland that would cease to be grassland in the absence of human intervention and that is speciesrich and not degraded and has been identified as being highly biodiverse by the relevant competent authority
566,195 Consistent with Statutory Management Directive 3 and 4 of the post 2020 CAP and specifically Council Directive 9243EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna OJ L 206 2271992 p 7 Article 61 and 2 and Directive 2009147EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds OJ L 20 2612010 p 7 Article 31 Article 32b Article 41 2 and 4
567,Manufacturing is the second largest contributor to CO2e emissions but is also be able to produce the products and technologies that can contribute to GHG emissions reductions in other sectors of the economy and is thus a fundamental part of the lowcarbon economy
568,The manufacturing section of the Taxonomy therefore includes both the manufacturing of lowcarbon technologies as well as energy intensive and hardtoabate manufacturing sectors It aims to give support to those economic activities that are low in carbon emissions and first movers who are engaging in a transformational shift
569,The economic activities covered include sectors that account for a high share of industrial GHG emissions as a result of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions related to the manufacture of the products and therefore offer large potential for GHG emissions reduction Specifically this includes the manufacturing of aluminium NACE 2442 the manufacturing of iron and steel NACE 241 242 243 the manufacturing of cement NACE 2351 and the manufacturing of chemicals NACE 2013 2014 2015 2016
570,Additionally enabling activities are also included in manufacturing which covers both those activities included under low carbon technologies and also mitigation measures which when combined result in achievement of the thresholds
571,machinery that are essential to a number of key renewable energy technologies geothermal power hydropower concentrated solar power CSP solar photovoltaic PV technology wind energy and ocean energy the manufacturing of lowcarbon transport vehicles fleets and vessels the manufacturing of energy efficiency equipment for buildings and other lowcarbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in further sectors of the economy including private households
572,Mitigation measures are included as enabling activities since they are recognised as critical steps supporting the transition of economic activities in these high emitting manufacturing sectors towards reaching the defined thresholds
573,The TEG acknowledges that many manufacturing activities are still not currently covered in the Taxonomy and this must be addressed It should be stated however that the TEG have not assumed that omitted activities are nongreen or brown Due to limited time the TEG has focused its attention on those economic activities likely to play the biggest role in leading Europe down a lowcarbon pathway to meet its Paris Agreement and 2050 climate neutrality goals Therefore the first round of sectors included in the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy are either those energy intensive and hardtoabate sectors that emit the most greenhouse gas emissions or those enabling manufacturing sectors that are clearly necessary for Europes lowcarbon economic transformation This means that other manufacturing sectors including other energyintensive sectors are not currently included even if they are significant in their impact
574,The manufacturing activities addressed in this first draft of the mitigation Taxonomy are considered to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation if the specific thresholds set for each activity are reached eg producing cement with GHG emissions lower than 0498 tCO2et of cement The criteria focus instead on reducing the GHG emissions caused by manufacturing activities up to the levels of performance achieved by best performers The criteria cover in general both scope 1 and 2 emissions Additionally in a number of sectors the requirement to limit GHG emissions to the level set in the EU ETS benchmarks has been complemented by other thresholds eg on the energy efficiency and carbon intensity of the electricity used or by alternative qualitative criteria eg making production of recycled aluminium eligible
575,The EU ETS benchmarks have been the main reference for setting such thresholds as they correspond to the level of performance achieved by the 10 best installations in the EU and are updated regularly The platform is recommended to review whether additional requirements could be set for those economic activities where BATAssociated Energy Efficiency Levels BATAEELs exist or are developed over time based on such levels The implications of this in terms of global applicability of the Taxonomy will need to be considered A regular update is also is needed to assess if alternative low carbon technologies have become market ready and commercially available This may result in alternative threshold criteria for activities that currently have a threshold based on EU ETS benchmarks
576,The thresholds for the manufacturing activities are predominantly tied to EU ETS benchmarks That means that the thresholds reflect the average performance of the 10 most efficient installations in a particular sector EU ETS benchmarks have been selected because they are the most robust benchmarks available and the data calculated according to the boundaries set are readily available for all installations within the EU that are part of the EU ETS scheme Although performance data using such metrics are not necessarily readily available for nonEU installations the methodologies can be followed and therefore can also be calculated univocally for nonEU installations Additionally the EU ETS benchmarks are periodically updated approximately every 5 years meaning that the thresholds that refer to them will not be static over time but automatically continue to represent the performance of the 10 best performing plants
577,The TEG recognizes that there are disadvantages to using the EU ETS benchmarks The benchmarks are based on EU historic trends rather than global data Moreover EU ETS benchmarks do not consider the full lifecycle of a process or product but are focused on scope 1 andor scope 2 GHG emissions Therefore EU ETS benchmarks do not directly support recycling or improvement in upstream emissions Mindful of these limitations the TEG has actively looked for equally robust data sources but has to date not been able to identify equally robust data sources Where equally robust data can be provided these should be considered by the Platform
578,There are no explicit thresholds for those manufacturing activities listed under the category low carbon technologies No criteria on the GHG emissions from manufacturing of listed products are specified since the mitigation benefits of these products components equipment and technology are considered to outweigh the emissions generated as a result of the manufacturing process to generate them This uncomprehensive list is complemented by additional criteria that allow additional products components equipment or technologies to be considered eligible if the overall benefits in terms of GHG emissions
579,Mitigation measures are eligible for inclusion under manufacturing when expenditures in energy efficiency measures process improvements and all other mitigation measures in one of the eligible manufacturing activities support closing the gap between the current level of efficiency and the level considered substantially contributing to mitigation objectives as defined by the thresholds This has two implications for users of the Taxonomy
580,For private finance users of the Taxonomy where revenues from Taxonomy eligible activities count such as equities the share of a corporation would be considered eligible based on the share of revenues from Taxonomyeligible activities only manufacturing activities complying with the activity threshold would be considered eligible
581,For the uses of the Taxonomy where expenditures in Taxonomyeligible measures count such as for financing projects green mortgages the use of proceeds from green bonds or simply counting how much a corporation has invested in climate mitigation all the investments needed to reach the activity threshold would be considered eligible This means that measures are eligible once they are implemented entirely and the threshold is reached as well as if individual investments in different measures are implemented over a defined time span as part of an overall investment plan eg 5 or 10 years and substantially support the activity achieving the thresholds
582,In the manufacturing sector certain processes are difficult to reduce to very low carbon levels particularly in the metals minerals and chemical sectors In those cases switching to renewable energy sources and energy efficient measures are not feasible options and very low carbon levels may only be achieved by either implementing an alternative manufacturing process like switching to the production of alternative products or due to the introduction of carbon capture and storage CCS technologies which are addressed in another section of the Taxonomy Additionally if CCS enables an economic activity in the manufacturing sector to meet its screening criteria the installation of CCS technology can be considered Taxonomy eligible once the screening criteria has been met This also applies to overall economic activity Carbon Capture and Utilisation CCU where the captured CO2 is utilized as a feed stock eg for a chemical process may also qualify if substantial mitigation impacts can be demonstrated by reducing emissions towards meeting the activity criteria eg the use of CO2 for enhanced oil extraction would not qualify
583,Due to the nature of manufacturing and in order to undertake a proper systemic value chain approach in the Taxonomy close linkages have been made with the energy transport agriculture and building sectors Where possible circularity considerations in so far as they affect GHG emissions and a broader value chain approach have been considered Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply chains the future Platform will need to review the thresholds to assess whether changes will be necessary to accommodate the planned circular economy objectives of the Taxonomy ieit is recommended that at the point in time when the Platform work to define threshold criteria for meeting substantial circular economy contributions the manufacturing thresholds currently defined with regard to mitigation and adaptation objectives are reviewed
584,In June 2019 the TEG published its report on EU Taxonomy196 The manufacturing group were very pleased to receive the rich and insightful comments which have inform the TEG It should be noted that some sectors submitted their comments collectively through an industry representative where as others submitted similar or identical text multiple times What follows is an overview of how the TEG subgroup has worked to respond to the Call for Feedback to get feedback on the publications
585,1 The most contentious aspect in manufacturing in terms of the highest number of disagreements was in relation to the list of low carbon technologies list Most of the submissions many of them identical were requesting additional technologies to be included in the list These were reviewed and appropriate amendments were made to the list in the light of these comments
586,2 Stakeholder expressed concerns about the stringency of the thresholds for the manufacture of hydrogen given the need for green hydrogen to contribute to a 2050 zero future As a result of feedback the thresholds were amended
587,3 There were multiple requests for a lifecycle analysis of steel to be taken into account in thresholds proposed to acknowledge that steel is a material that can fully be recycled and will continue to play a role in a low carbon economy We acknowledge the role that steel may play in the supply chain efficiencies but for practical reasons have limited the scope of thresholds proposed to the production of primary steel and steel recycling only At this stage circular economy criteria for steel are not proposed and need to be developed in a later stage In this respect the manufacturing of eg aluminium or cement is dealt with in a similar way
588,4 It was noted that there many of the submission relating to different manufacturing activities including cement were not purely of technical nature but were rather presented as a position The TEG has worked to ensure that the thresholds applied promote low carbon production
589,5 There was some considerable concern from stakeholders about the manufacture of plastics particularly single source plastic production Many of the submissions recommended a circular economic perspective be introduced In response the threshold has become more explicit in limiting eligibility to those plastic manufactures where at least 90 of the final plastic is not used for single use consumer products and is not recycled This needs to be confirmed needs to be confirmed from sciencebased researchstudies etc
590,1 The TEG recognizes that the scope of the manufacturing section of the Taxonomy should be extended to cover more manufacturing activities Care must continue to be taken to review the context in which the Taxonomy is applied to ensure that it does not identify activities as green which have perverse incentives or a negative impact on other environmental objectives From a manufacturing perspective the TEG
591,manufacturing and textiles The manufacturing processes for these activities are complex multiple and result in the production of an array of diverse products The TEG recommends that the future platform address these manufacturing sectors by prioritising those processes that contribute the most significant portion of emissions eg steam generation in the paper and pulp sector and work to establish thresholds for these specific processes
592,carbon technologies by providing the critical materials needed for lowcarbon technologies as well as the value chain link with energyintensive manufacturing sectors Unfortunately the TEG was not able to complete work for this sector due to time constraints and the complexity of the issues The TEG recommends that the platform analyse the role the sector plays in terms of enhancing availability of the critical materials needed for current and future technologies to create a climate neutral circular and resource efficient economy while sourcing raw materials in a sustainable and responsible way with a view to consider the enabling potential of the sector The platform is recommended to ensure that a life cycle approach is applied when assessing the different phases of the value chain for mining is applied The rational for applying life cycle analysis is that many metals are essential for lowcarbon technologies For example Aluminium for lightweight cars Copper for electrics and motors in electric vehicles solar panels and wind turbines Battery metals Cobalt Lead Lithium Manganese and Nickel for clean mobility and grid storage batteries Zinc and Cobalt for protecting offshore wind turbines Silicon in solar panels Precious metals for clean mobility and solar panels
593,Further analysis for light manufacturing sectors may also need to be considered by the platform as these sectors grow in impact For these the platform could either try to develop individual activity criteria for each where feasible or identify key improvement measures applicable across a number of these sectors and classify them as individual enabling activities
594,aluminium referred to as red mud contains toxic heavy metals and its high alkalinity makes it corrosive and damaging to soil and life forms presenting potentially substantial impacts when disposed Toxic dumps and settling pools are a feature alongside all bauxitealumina plants worldwide including across Europe Russia China Guinea Brazil Jamaica and Australia The global average of bauxite residue generated per tonne of alumina is between 1 and 15 tonnes it is estimated that over 150 million tonnes of bauxite residue are produced annually  56 million tonnes in Europe alone and the majority of this waste is being landfilled The platform is recommended to consider the impacts of red mud under minimum social and health safeguards and develop an approach to set up criteria to integrate this within the DNSH environmental impact
595,for all chemicalsproductsbyproducts contained in the taxonomy It is to be noted that other organic and inorganic chemicalsproductsbyproducts included in the taxonomy are also potentially hazardous to human health and the environment depending upon the exposure scenarios and therefore objective scientifically robust riskbased assessments should be carried out for all
596,Furthermore the platform should take into consideration the value chain and circular economy aspects of chemicalsproductsbyproducts For example Chlorine and PVC are required for the production of PVC doors and windows which are necessary for improved energy efficiency of the building sector Such value chain and CE considerations would follow a similar logic applied to soda ash in the current version of the Taxonomy on the basis that it is required for glazing of double and triple glazed windows
597,impact of applying an additional requirement that for those economic activities where BAT Associated Energy Efficiency Levels BATAEELs exist these must also be met The implications of this in terms of global application of the Taxonomy will need to be considered
598,For example heat pumps LED lighting Hot water fittings eg taps showers that are rated in the top class dark green of the European Water Label Scheme httpwwweuropeanwaterlabeleu  may be produced by a factory or company but other things may also be produced
599,cement eg concrete for specific building applications The focus should be on the substitution of clinker by binders with a lower content of embedded CO2 Cement is currently produced in many different qualities which are sometimes used in different applications As a result exchange between two qualities is not always possible Therefore on the way to a climateneutral economy it has to be determined which types of cement in which application areas can be replaced by those with a reduced clinker content taking into account the availability of clinker substitutes Within the decarbonisation of other industries it may be possible that material flows used today eg fly ash will no longer be available in the future as a clinker substitute while the suitability of other materials has not yet been proven The cement types which are absolutely necessary in a climateneutral economy and cannot be replaced must be produced in a climatefriendly way For these types it then should be examined to what extent the clinker ratio can be lowered how energy efficiency can be increased how electricity from renewable energies can be used etc
600, The mitigation thresholds proposed in the taxonomy for manufacturing specifically address the segment in the supply chain with the highest direct emissions ie the scope 1 and 2 emissions related to the manufacturing of the product Given the role of the manufacturing sector in supply chains circular economy objectives are of particular relevance for this sector Once threshold criteria for meeting substantial circular economy contributions are being developed we recommend reviewing these in the context of the mitigation threshold criteria which address a specific segment of the circular economy For example improving LCA within the manufacturing sector For example LCA consideration of products steelaluminiumcement
601,taken by the platform to address two issues first the possibility of looking at data complementary to the ETS benchmarks and secondly to ensure that a more complete value chain analysis is undertaken which will include resource efficiency in order to match current legislative discussions around circularity and critical materialsuse including responsible sourcing
602,The manufacture of low carbon technologies that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy including private households is eligible provided that product related emissions are at least the level of best available techniques ie a factory that produces electric cars but burns coal is not eligible
603,1 Manufacture of products key components and machinery that are essential for eligible renewable energy technologies Geothermal Power Hydropower Concentrated Solar Power CSP Solar Photovoltaic PV solar thermal energy for district heat production Wind energy Ocean energy bio energy technologies that meet the conversion efficiency requirements set in the Renewable Energy Directive 20182001EU and Green hydrogen and hydrogen electrolysis installation197
604,197 Hydrogen electrolysis installation will be part of the taxonomy if it shows a considerable level of green electricity consumption and shows a pathway towards an increased share of green electricity over the years to come
605,Zero direct emission heavyduty vehicles that emits less than 1g CO2kWh or 1g CO2km for certain N2 vehicles lowemission heavyduty vehicles with specific direct CO2emissions of less than 50 of the reference CO2emissions of all vehicles in the same subgroup
606,Highly efficient space heating and domestic hot water systems rated in the highest energy efficiency class significantly populated in the energy efficiency label or higher classes according to EU energy labelling regulations
607,4 The manufacture of low carbon technologies and their key components that result in substantial GHG emission reductions in other sectors of the economy including private households is eligible if they demonstrate substantial higher net GHG emission reductions compared to the best performing alternative technology product solution available on the market on the basis of a recognisedstandardised cradletocradle carbon footprint assessment eg ISO 14067 14040 EPD or PEF validated by a third party
608,However in some cases the list is less broad than the eligible activities in the corresponding section of the Taxonomy due to limited resources to explore in this phase the implications for use in other sectors of the same products components equipment and infrastructure Further analysis is required to ensure no perverse incentives occur
609,For transport the manufacture is focused on the production of complete low carbon or zero carbon vehicles fleets or vessels so that either revenue from sales of eligible vehicles or expenditure on investments in manufacturing capacity specifically relating to eligible vehicles can be identified
610,Depending on the productequipment being manufactured there may also be issues with respect to the embodied carbon and the demand for certain metals and materials eg rare earth metals which are in limited supply and may have significant environmental impact issues associated with the mining phase
611,Identify and manage risks related to water quality andor water consumption at the appropriate level Ensure that water useconservation management plans developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders have been developed and implemented
612,Embodied carbon emissions should represent less than 50 of the total carbon emissions saved by the use of the energy efficient equipment Carbon emissions and savings at the endoflife stage are not included in the assessment for this criteria too uncertain
613,Compliance with the REACH Registration Evaluation Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation 12722008EC and the RoHS Restriction of Hazardous Substances Regulation 200295EC or the equivalent for equipment manufactured and used outside the EU nb equipment manufactured outside of the EU but imported into the EU must comply with the REACH and RoHS Regulations
614,Ensure an Environmental Impact Assessment EIA has been completed in accordance with the EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment 201452EU and Strategic Environmental Assessment 200142EC or other equivalent national provisions or international standards eg IFC Performance Standard 1 Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks  whichever is stricter  in the case of sitesoperations in nonEU countries for the siteoperation including ancillary services eg transport infrastructure and operations waste disposal facilities etc and any required mitigation measures for protecting biodiversityecosystems in particular UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas KBAs have been implemented
615,For sitesoperations located in or near to biodiversitysensitive areas including the Natura 2000 network of protected areas as well as other protected areas ensure that an appropriate assessment has been conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Biodiversity Strategy COM 2011 244 the Birds 2009147EC and Habitats 9243EEC Directives or other equivalent national provisions or international standards eg IFC Performance Standard 6  whichever is stricter  in case of sitesoperations in nonEU countries based on the conservation objectives of the protected area For such sitesoperations ensure that
616,The manufacturing of cement is associated with significant CO2 emissions Minimising process emissions through energy efficiency improvements and switch to alternative fuels promoting the reduction of the clinker to cement ration and the use of alternative clinkers and binders can contribute to the mitigation objective
617,Mitigation measures are eligible provided they are incorporated into a single investment plan within a determined time frame 5 or 10 years that outlines how each of the measures in combination with others will in combination enable the activity to meet the threshold defined below actions
618,Cement production is responsible for more than 70 of the emissions under C23 and concrete is the most significant application for the use of cement Cement is the main constituent of concrete The content of cement in the concrete and total GHG emissions can vary significantly based on the
619,198 Based on the EU ETS benchmark for grey cement clinker httpseurlexeuropaeulegal contentENTXTPDFuriCELEX32011D0278fromEN  The threshold for cement clinker needs to be revised every time that there is an update in the EU ETS benchmark value for grey cement clinker
620,199 Threshold was derived taking into account the threshold for cement clinker and the threshold for clinker to cement ratio It excludes emissions from electricity use that is mainly required for finish grinding raw materials grinding and the exhaust fans kilnraw mill and cement mill
621,The absolute performance approach has been proposed in order to identify the maximum acceptable carbon intensity that the activity should comply with in order to be able to substantially contribute to the mitigation objective
622,The main users of electricity in cement plants are the mills grinding of cement milling of raw materials and the exhaust fans kilnraw mill and cement mill which together account for more than 80 of the electrical energy usage The electricity demand in cement plants ranges from 90 to 150 kWht cement202
623,A global average electric energy demand for cement manufacturing of 104 kWht cement was reported by Cement Sustainability Initiative CSI for the years 2012 to 2014203 The CSI data cover more than 900 plants worldwide and all technologies and clinker and cement types The variations in the data are significant The 10 best in class show figures of 85 kWht cement and below while the 90 percentile amounted to 129 kWht cement
624,Taking into account that the decarbonisation of the cement sector will run in parallel with the decarbonisation of the energy sector it is expected that the electricity required as auxiliary power for cement manufacture in the near future will come from renewable sources and thus a specific threshold for specific electricity consumption is not proposed Based on the abovementioned information and sources it is expected that the best in class plants have specific electricity consumption of 85 KWh t cement
625,Improving energy efficiency Thermal energy intensity of clinker and the electric intensity of cement can be reduced by deploying existing stateoftheart technologies in new cement plants and retrofitting existing facilities to improve energy performance levels when economically viable   Switching to alternative fuels The carbon intensity of cement clinker can be reduced significantly by the use of biomass and waste materials as fuels in cement kilns The clinker burning process offers good conditions for using different types of waste materials replacing parts of the consumption of carbonintensive fossil fuels A wide range of different types of wastes can be used as fuels but as these can replace primary fuel in cement kilns a consistent waste quality is essential eg adequate calorific value metal halogen and ash content
626,Reducing the clinker to cement ratio Increasing the use of blended materials and the market deployment of blended cements is very important for the decarbonisation of the sector and alignment with a low carbon pathway This requires substitution of cement clinker by mineral additives such as fly ash silica fume or blastfurnace slag The amount of clinker substitute that can be blended in the cement depends on the type of substitute and the type of cement produced Some mineral additives eg GBFS allow for substitution levels of over 70 per cent Revision of the cement and concrete standards building codes and public procurement regulations would be required in order to allow more widespread use of blended cements with very high substitution of clinker eg 60 while ensuring product reliability and durability at final application
627,Alternative clinkers and binders Alternative clinker formulations eg belite CSA BCSA CACS MOMS and alternative binders eg alkaliactivated binders could offer potential opportunities for CO2 emissions reductions by using different mixes of raw materials or alternatives compared to Portland cement Their commercial availability and applicability differ widely Further efforts are required to support the demonstration testing and earlier stage research for alternative clinkers and binders and to develop standards to facilitate market deployment The specification of the benchmark based on ton of binder will allow investments in these types of novel alternative binders to be considered for eligibility under the EU Sustainable Taxonomy

746,Heat and electricity generation are responsible for over a quarter of the EUs greenhouse gas emissions237 Ambitious emissions reductions in this sector are vital to decarbonisation The Taxonomy work on the heat and power sector has attempted to recognise this finding by developing suitably ambitious requirements within a model of supporting a transition to the EUs emission reduction goals
747,This section covers a wide range of activities pertaining to the production storage and delivery of heat and electrical energy Technologyagnostic criteria have been developed for different sources of electricity and heating and cooling This section also recognizes the important role that improvements to the supporting infrastructure associated with delivering both types of energy will play in meeting the EUs netzero emissions objective The TEG has developed these Taxonomy criteria for the energy sector so they can be used globally
748,An overarching technologyagnostic emissions intensity threshold of 100g CO2e  kWh is proposed for electricity generation heat production and the cogeneration of heat and electricity This threshold will be reduced every five years in line with political targets set out to achieve netzero emissions by 2050
749,For electricity and heat generation activities an ISO 14067 or a GHG Protocol Product Lifecycle Standard compliant Product Carbon Footprint PCF assessment including measurement of fugitive emissions is required This includes actual physical measurements of methane leakage from the point of extractionwellhead to production of energy electricity andor heat The TEG acknowledges that improved standards and methodologies will develop and recommend that the acceptance of the ISO 14067 GHG Protocol Product LIfecycle Standard and the PCF methodologies is reviewed periodically reviewed by the platform
750,To aid the transition to a netzero economy certain technologies such as solar wind and tidal energy are derogated from the requirement to conduct PCFs assessments on the basis that these technologies currently perform significantly below the emissions intensity threshold These derogations are subject to regular review in accordance with the declining threshold
751,Furthermore In the case where CCS is used to meet the emissions intensity threshold a contractual agreement is required as proof to show that the carbon will be transported and sequestered in economic activities which are themselves eligible under the taxonomy
752,237 Greenhouse gas emissions by economic activity according to the NACE classification EU28 2016 Eurostat env_ac_ainah_r2 httpseceuropaeueurostatstatisticsexplainedindexphpClimate_change_ _driving_forcesTotal_emissions2C_main_breakdowns_by_source_and_general_drivers
753,The threshold will be set at a single value for all new investments in electricity generation until it is revised in future It applies equally to the production of heating  cooling and cogeneration of heat and electricity
754,The TEG recognizes that complementary emissions reductions activities such as CCS or direct air capture with sequestration in a manner consistent with the corresponding EU Environmental Liability Directive Annex II page 12 may be attributed to an economic activitys emissions intensity as subject to the relevant activity threshold
755,238 Power plants can have typical lifetimes of between 15 and over 100 years depending on technology operating mode and maintenance profile 40 years is the maximum period over which the large majority of power plants can reasonably be expected to operate and emit GHGs without some form of repowering
756,Hydropower the embedded emissions associated with the construction of hydropower facilities and the alteration of landscapes constitute a significant portion of lifecycle analysis emissions Such emissions can be compensated for by a complementary emissions reduction activity as mentioned above
757,The energy working group thanks all respondents to energy criteria for their time and effort invested to provide input and help improve the energy taxonomy criteria The following brief summary tries to highlight key feedback The energy working group has evaluated the feedback and used the feedback in developing this report
758,activities Stakeholders noted this might not fully be technology neutral This includes some technologies being exempted from LCE analysis requirements Other respondents suggested increasing the exemption list from LCE assessments
759,Directive for DNSH and bioenergy as outlined by some respondents Where there are standards and requirements it was suggested making reference to them within the EU Taxonomy Some respondents also noted that the EU Taxonomy should be structured in a way that minimises additional burden
760,In addition to the feedback received on the activities covered within the Technical Report for the EU Taxonomy from June 2019 several stakeholders would have liked to see the inclusion or a stronger acknowledgement of nuclear energy wastetoenergy and unabated natural gas
761,Adjustments to thresholds energy thresholds should be revisited on a fiveyear basis in order to reflect state of the art research and progress on decarbonisation efforts Particularly the emission threshold for electricity generation should be reduced every five years
762,Inclusion of new technologies technological progress could allow for market entry in the near future Technologies with a sufficiently high technology readiness level TRL could be added to the Taxonomy eg nuclear fusion
763,The TEG also recognises that the use of biomass for energy requires tradeoff decisions relative to other potential uses and across mitigation activities but also for do no significant harm dimensions For these reasons the TEG recognises that possible production and use of bioenergy will require further consideration as the Taxonomy is developed and based on technical feedback in the outreach period
764,The TEG adopted a technologyneutral approach that can ensure rapid decarbonisation within the electricity sector Adherence to the declining emissions intensity threshold is technically feasible for virtually any energy generation technology However it does imply that unabated fossil fuel combustion namely coal and natural gas will be ineligible under the Taxonomy
765,On waste incineration with energy recovery wastetoenergy WtE experts opinions differed on whether this would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution to climate mitigation On the one hand there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE These highlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled the reliance of some individual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste and the risk that further increasing capacities risk overcapacity and could result in lockin effects This would in turn discourage more reuse and recycling options higher in the waste hierarchy that could deliver higher climate mitigation benefits On the other hand it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly circular economy as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled as acknowledged by the EC in its Communication COM201734 on the role of wastetoenergy in the circular economy Section 5 According to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation any activity leading to a significant increase in the incineration including WtE of waste is not considered an eligible activity as it causes harm to the environmental objective of the circular economy as per Article 12d of the EU Taxonomy regulation with the exception of the incineration of nonrecyclable hazardous waste This exception was not part of the Commissions proposal which considered any significant increase of incineration capacity harmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible Therefore the TEG has not included WtE but recommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on Sustainable Finance in light of the changes in the political agreement text
766,The TEG assessed nuclear energy as part of its review on energy generation activities Nuclear energy generation has near to zero greenhouse gas emissions in the energy generation phase and can be a contributor to climate mitigation objectives Consideration of nuclear energy by the TEG from a climate mitigation perspective was therefore warranted
767,The proposed Taxonomy regulation and thus TEGs methodology for including activities in the Taxonomy explicitly includes two equally important aspects Substantial Contribution to one environmental objective
768,and Do No Significant Harm DNSH to the other environmental objectives In making its recommendations the TEG used evidence and expert opinion from others but ultimately was mandated to make recommendations about the inclusion of economic activities and screening criteria in the Taxonomy
769,Evidence on the potential substantial contribution of nuclear energy to climate mitigation objectives was extensive and clear The potential role of nuclear energy in low carbon energy supply is well documented240241
770,On potential significant harm to other environmental objectives including circular economy and waste management biodiversity water systems and pollution the evidence about nuclear energy is complex and more difficult to evaluate in a taxonomy context Evidence often addresses different aspects of the risks and management practices associated with nuclear energy Scientific peerreviewed evidence of the risk of significant harm to pollution and biodiversity objectives arising from the nuclear value chain was received and considered by the TEG 242243244 Evidence regarding advanced risk management procedures and regulations to limit harm to environmental objectives was also received This included evidence of multiple engineered safeguards designed to reduce the risks Despite this evidence there are still empirical data gaps on key DNSH issues
771,For example regarding the longterm management of HighLevel Waste HLW there is an international consensus that a safe longterm technical solution is needed to solve the present unsustainable situation A combination of temporary storage plus permanent disposal in geological formation is the most promising with some countries are leading the way in implementing those solutions Yet nowhere in the world has a viable safe and longterm underground repository been established245246 It was therefore infeasible for the TEG to undertake a robust DNSH assessment as no permanent operational disposal site for HLW exists yet from which longterm empirical insitu data and evidence to inform such an evaluation for nuclear energy

775,Given these limitations it was not possible for TEG nor its members to conclude that the nuclear energy value chain does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives on the time scales in question The TEG has therefore not recommended the inclusion of nuclear energy in the Taxonomy at this stage Further the TEG recommends that more extensive technical work is undertaken on the DNSH aspects of nuclear energy in future and by a group with indepth technical expertise on nuclear life cycle technologies and the existing and potential environmental impacts across all objectives
776,The experts identified further economic activities which could be relevant for the Taxonomy However constrained by limited manpower these activities could not be assessed in detail and are for future consideration by the Platform Such economic activities may include
777,Furthermore the TEG acknowledges that improved standards and methodologies will develop and recommend that the acceptance of the ISO 14067 GHG Protocol Product LIfecycle Standard and the PCF methodologies is reviewed periodically reviewed by the platform
778,Finally criteria for manufacture of biomass biogas and biofuels and use of these fuels in energy and transport are currently limited to advanced biofuels as per Article 2 34 of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II Directive EU 20182001 For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but may offer substantial climate mitigation benefits the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation
779,Similarly the TEG recommends that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteria for the manufacture of renewable liquid and gaseous transport fuels of nonbiological origin as defined by Article 2 36 under the Directive EU 20182001 as this has been included in the Transport criteria of the Taxonomy

851,To determine eligibility it is possible to consider a System covering multiple control areas which are interconnected and with significant energy exchanges between them In such a case the weighted average emissions factor across all included control areas is used to determine eligibility and individual subordinated transmission or distribution systems within this System will not be required to demonstrate compliance separately
852,It is possible for a System to become ineligible after having previously been eligible In Systems that become ineligible no new TD activities are eligible from that moment onward until the system is again in compliance with the threshold except for those activities which are always eligible see above Activities in subordinated Systems may still be eligible if these subordinated Systems meet the criteria of this Taxonomy
853,Increasing access to electricity will support its decarbonisation by enabling more consumers to transition from carbonintensive energy supply while increasing the utilisation of renewable energy As countries continue to fulfil their decarbonisation objectives there will be fewer and fewer investments in transmission and distribution which are not climate aligned
854,Under this logic we propose that most investments in electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure in Systems where a significant majority of new generation capacity is from low carbon generation sources should be considered climatealigned under the EU Taxonomy
855,The impacts of transmission and distribution lines are a function of the spatial alignment of the grid the structures and conductors required for various voltages the extent to which preexisting corridors are used and how the transmission and distribution lines are operated and maintained The most common environmental impacts of electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure are visual ecosystem and land use In the cases of underground offshore electricity lines water and marine resources may be impacted

955,The Production of HeatCool and Power from Bioenergy can deliver mitigation benefits but if done incorrectly can have no net positive impact or even a negative impact Thus the eligibility criteria are based on existing EU regulation but seek to advance the agenda by setting a higher threshold on the required GHG emissions savings outlined in RED II and restricting eligibility to advanced bioenergy feedstocks

974,The subsector Water Sewerage Waste and Remediation WSWR covering NACECodes E36 to E39 contributes to a rather small share of the EUs total greenhouse gas emissions  water with 02 and sewerage waste remediation with 44 in 2016 However advanced solid waste management has a great potential to trigger greenhouse gas emission reductions in other sectors of the economy through waste prevention separate waste collection waste reuse and recycling
975,In the waste sector a systems approach describing the climate mitigation effects of an integrated package of closely interrelated and combined environmentally sustainable activities would have its merits As however the scope of the Taxonomy subgroup was to define standalone activities the chosen climate mitigation principles metrics and thresholds were formulated in a way to allow for the assessment of singular activities without consideration of their linkages in a complex waste management system respectively waste hierarchy
976,NACE Codes E3812 collection of hazardous waste E3822 treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and E3831 dismantling of wrecks eg automobiles ships etc were found to be of less relevance from a climate mitigation perspective and thus reprioritized for later consideration by the Platform on Sustainable Finance see section on next steps further below
977,On waste incineration with energy recovery wastetoenergy WtE experts opinions differed on whether this would be an appropriate environmentally sustainable activity offering a substantial contribution to climate mitigation On the one hand there were arguments against the inclusion of WtE These highlighted the large portion of waste currently incinerated that could be recycled the reliance of some individual Member States on the incineration of municipal waste and the risk that further increasing capacities risk overcapacity and could result in lockin effects This would in turn discourage more reuse and recycling options higher in the waste hierarchy and that can deliver higher climate mitigation benefits On the other hand it was emphasized that WtE has a role to play even in an increasingly circular economy as not all residual waste can be reused or recycled as acknowledged by the EC in its Communication COM201734 on the role of wastetoenergy in the circular economy Section 5 According to the political agreement on the Taxonomy Regulation any activity leading to a significant increase in the incineration including WtE of waste is not considered an eligible activity as it causes harm to the environmental objectives of the circular economy as per Article 12d of the EU Taxonomy regulation with the exception of the incineration of nonrecyclable hazardous waste This exception was not part of the Commissions proposal which considered any significant increase of incineration capacity harmful to the circular economy and hence ineligible Therefore the TEG has not included WtE but recommends bringing this matter for further discussion and consideration to the Platform on Sustainable Finance in light of the changes in the political agreement text
978,The main issues raised in the public feedback on activities in the subsector WSWR related to broadening the scope of some activities For anaerobic digestion of biowaste and similar for anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and landfill gas capture and utilization respondents suggested to allow for additional uses of the produced biogas or landfill gas For the anaerobic digestion of biowaste respondents warned against the exclusion of certain crops and against the exclusion of blending of feedstocks Both issues are reflected in the revised criteria
979,An important characteristic of subsector WSWR is that for the identified activities  with the exception of water collection treatment and supply  the climate mitigation effect is an inherent result of key characteristic of the corresponding business model for example the energetic utilization of biogas produced through the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge and biowaste or the material recovery from waste for reuse or recycling in other sectors Hence the choice of climate mitigation criteria mainly focuses on qualitative metrics that seek to securing the execution of the activitiesbusinesses themselves
980,Only in water collection treatment and supply  namely water supply  the climate mitigation effect is the result of a more efficient design of the production process eg by raising pump efficiency or reducing leakages Consequently concrete quantitative thresholds were defined with a first option describing an ambitious level of high energy efficiency in the water collection treatment and supply system and with a second option setting thresholds for the substantial improvement of the systems energy efficiency
981,Given the heterogeneity of WSWR it is challenging to establish a set of one size fits all criteria This point was raised in the public consultation feedback However it is the view of the TEG that these criteria  even if some are referencing to EU regulation  are globally relevant for the contribution of WSWR to a
982,The activities do not impose major additional implementation costs on the stakeholders because as explained for most of them  except water collection treatment and supply  the climate mitigation effects are an inherent result of key characteristics of the correspondent business models and thus should come along without significant further cost Considering water collection treatment and supply additional investments may be necessary in order to reach certain thresholds however the corresponding costs may partially be equalized by cost savings from higher energy efficiency
983,There should be no systematic distortive effect of the activities on the number and competitive position of the companies in the corresponding sectors The overall sectoral technological impact will depend on the state of the water wastewater and waste management in each Member State in terms of eg regional coverage of different management technologies Outside of the EU the technological impact could be even greater if the state of the sector in an individual country or region is below that of the EU
984,Clear additional beneficial environmental effects can be assumed for eg water circular economy and pollution Employment effects should be positive and further beneficial economic impacts are induced through increased investments and the demand for consumer goods
985,Carbon capture and sequestration CCS is a key technology for the decarbonisation of Europe It is included in all pathways presented by the European Commission in its LongTerm Strategic Vision document and is relied upon heavily in threeoutoffour scenarios outlined by the IPCC in the Special Report on 15 Degrees
986,A typical CCS chain consists of three main stages capture transport and storage CO2 transport and storage are established and proven processes with decades of operation and wellestablished regulation here in Europe
987,The Technical Expert Group has developed criteria to define the eligibility of facilities used to capture carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere and separately to capture carbon dioxide directly from anthropogenic activities
988,CCS facilitates the direct mitigation of both fossil and process emissions in many industrial sectors including steel cement and chemicals Time is a crucial factor the later options for deep decarbonisation in an industry arise the more costly they become and the more likely the need for greater carbon dioxide removal
989,In addition to renewable energies energy storage and demandside management CCS on dispatchable generation allows all aspects of the electricity supply system to be deeply decarbonised284 CCS provides a backstop to the unabated operation of flexible electricity generation plants that are required to guarantee the operation and supply of yearround electricity This is especially true in more isolated grids with a high penetration of seasonally variable renewables eg onshore and offshore wind where the reliable operation of electricity networks requires ondemand electricity generation
990,Whilst some CO2 capture technologies can incur an energy penalty of 1015 others do not For example the Allam cycle being developed by Net Power on natural gas combustion for power generation does not incur an energy penalty as supercritical CO2 is integrated fully into the power cycle as a coolant This significantly reduces both energy and water demand It is therefore inaccurate to say that CCS is a highly energyintensive technology
991,The transport and storage of CO2 should be considered essential to the infrastructure of a modern sustainable society It can aid electricity grid expansion the integration of renewables and the deep decarbonisation of energy intensive industries support and enable CO2 removal and help stimulate a green hydrogen market Without CO2 transport and storage infrastructure Europe will not achieve its climate objectives
992,Chemically CO2 bonds with surrounding minerals after injection gradual refossilisation making CO2 storage sites safer as time progresses The IPCC estimates that over 999 of CO2 will remain underground The EU has provided clear and extensive assessment and monitoring requirements through the 2009 CO2 Storage Directive CO2 has already been safely stored in geological formations in Europe for over 20 years
993,Through decadelong CO2 injection experiences in North America and the monitoring of CO2 storage in Europe the safe final disposal of CO2 both on and offshore has already been established Selected sources on risk and safety of CO2 storage can be found in the footnotes285286287288289290291292293294
994,The Platform on Sustainable Finance to come is expected to review several activities By 2025 the threshold in Option 2 of water collection treatment and supply will have to be assessed for adjustment as the standards in the water supply sector and the technologies develop over time Further by 2025 the platform shall assess whether the Taxonomy has incentivized for landfill gas capture and energetic utilization the closure of existing landfills and the increase of landfill gas capture as intended
995,The experts identified further economic activities which could be relevant for the Taxonomy However constrained by limited manpower these activities could not be assessed in detail and are for future consideration by the Platform Such economic activities may include
996,economic activities promoting the reuse of products andor preparing products for reuse through the establishment of reuse and repair networks and dedicated separate collection and reverse logistics systems

1001,By 2025 the Sustainable Finance Platform should assess the feasibility of Option 2 in particular with regard to the intended incentive for substantial energy efficiency improvements in water supply systems
1002,The water supply sector is a wide and varied sector with very different performance conditions depending on the water source the necessary treatment the topography of the supplied area the length of the network etc ILI and kwhm3 supplied are chosen as parameters in order to measure the efficiency of a water supply system
1003,An average energy consumption of a water supply system of 05 kwh per cubic meter billedunbilled authorized water supply indicates a high performing system in terms of energy consumption Several energy efficiency measures can reduce directly the energy consumption in a water supply system enabling significant reductions of GHG emissions these are inter alia
1004,An ILI of 15 represents a very efficient performance of the network with regards to water losses ILI incorporates in its definition the length of the supply network which makes it the most objective parameter Water losses management reduction of the ILI reduces indirectly the energy consumption in the whole water supply system thus enabling significant reductions of GHG emissions from the water supply system Water loss management measures consist inter alia of

1013,Sewage sludge is a byproduct of wastewater treatment with organic and inorganic content The organic content of the sludge is subject of decomposition which might occur under controlled circumstances in sludge treatment installations or under uncontrolled circumstances in the final disposal with significant GHG emissions mainly methane
1014,Anaerobic Digestion AD and in some cases aerobic digestion are examples of sludge treatments In AD microorganisms decompose the organic matter of the sludge in the absence of oxygen and produce methanerich biogas
1015,The primary climate mitigation effect of biogas is its use a source of renewable energy in multiple forms and applications displacing fossil fuels297 As an additional contribution to climate mitigation the sludge can be turned into a recyclable product eg as fertilizer substituting synthetic fertilizers

1032,Anaerobic digestion AD is a process by which microorganisms decompose biodegradable material in the absence of oxygen As part of an integrated waste management system AD is a valid route to divert biodegradable waste from landfilling and thus reduce the uncontrolled emissions of landfill gas in particular methane The AD process produces methanerich biogas under controlled conditions and a sludgelike or liquid residue termed digestate Biogas can be used in multiple forms and applications that displace fossil fuels
1033,The digestate is typically used on farmland as organic fertilizer directly or after a composting step The use of digestate instead of synthetic fertilizers derived from byproducts of the petroleum industry saves energy and reduces the consumption of fossil fuels Where there is no immediate use on farmland the digestate can be dewatered and cured by composting to stabilise the material which can be stored for longer time and used as an organic fertiliser or soil improver
1034,For the treatment of kitchen and food waste as well as other similar biowaste AD exhibits the best environmental and climate change mitigation performance compared to other forms of biological treatment and should therefore be given preference where it is technically and economically viable This depends on several local conditions304
1035,On the other hand biodegradable garden and park wastes and other biowaste with high ligneous content are typically not directly degradable by AD Where such biowaste fraction is significant it should be collected separately and treated by composting see Taxonomy Activity Composting of biowaste
1036,Codigestion of biowastes with solid or liquid manure and other agricultural residues as well as energy crops is sometimes practised to improve the stability of the AD process and increase biogas yields and is eligible under the conditions mentioned in the metrics Due care needs to be taken however to ensure that the use of the digestate or composts produced therefrom as a fertilizersoil conditioner is not negatively affected by such practice
1037,Methane leakage may offset the climate mitigation benefits and therefore needs to be avoided Specific monitoring is therefore needed to detect methane leakages from relevant facilities Where increasing methane emissions are detected it is in the interest of the operator to remove the causes through technical or operational measures in order to minimize economic losses305

1082,Currently transport operations consume onethird of all energy in the EU The bulk of this energy comes from oil This means that transport is responsible for a large share of the EUs greenhouse gas emissions and is a major contributor to climate change While most other economic sectors such as industry have reduced their emissions since 1990 those from transport have risen see Figure 1 Preliminary estimates from EU Member States show that GHG emissions from transport were 29 above 1990 levels in 2018322 They now account for more than one quarter of the EUs total greenhouse gas emissions This presents a major challenge in addressing transport sector emissions to ensure that the EUs emission reduction target is met Although vehicle efficiency improvements have had a mitigating effect on GHG emissions growing transport demand323 and a sluggish share of lowcarbon solutions have outweighed it
1083,Within the transport sector road transport is the dominant emissions source accounting for more than twothirds 717324 of transportrelated greenhouse gas emissions Passenger cars and vans are responsible for the bulk of these emissions the rest resulting from trucks and buses Road transport is followed by shipping and aviation as the second and third largest sources of GHG emissions from transport
1084,To make a substantial contribution to climate mitigation the activities and technical screening criteria hereafter criteria included in the Taxonomy need to focus on the main emissions sources from the transport sector Reducing the GHG emissions from road transport is therefore key For road vehicles there is a welldeveloped legislative framework in the EU that includes mandatory emissions testing This system is most mature for cars and vans It has recently evolved significantly for trucks and buses are set to follow
1085,Rail and inland waterways are also important emissions sources covered by the Taxonomy Compared to road and air they can provide modal shift benefits However EU legislation provides less direct orientation regarding these modes of transport
1086,While public transport and the infrastructure for lowcarbon transport in themselves are smaller sources of GHG emissions they are vital to achieve systemic change towards more sustainable mobility and are therefore also included in the Taxonomy
1087,The transport section of the climate mitigation Taxonomy deals primarily with climate mitigation activities regarding operations of vehiclevessel fleets and the associated enabling infrastructure The taxonomy criteria for the manufacturing of vehicles and vessels are addressed in Manufacturing and are based on the criteria in this section
1088,326 A Clean Planet for All A European longterm strategic vision for a prosperous modern competitive and climate neutral economyhttpseceuropaeuclimasitesclimafilesdocspagescom_2018_733_analysis_in_support_en_0pdf
1089,The general Taxonomy approach for the transport section was based on the agreed taxonomy regulation text328 and was inspired by the longterm strategic options for decarbonisation of the transport sector as per the Commissions longterm strategic vision A Clean Planet for All329 The associated criteria proposed has been grouped into three categories below as identified in the Long Term Strategy 330 Criteria developed for fleet efficiency and fuel substitution have been designed to be discrete and refer to relevant EU legislation331 For fleet efficiency criteria tanktowheel criteria have been used since the basis for criteria is the Clean Vehicles Directive the post2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans and the Heavy Duty CO2 regulation Lifecycle and welltowheel considerations for thresholds is pending on the possibility to develop and agree a common Union methodology in future as per the above mentioned legislations
1090,This category of criteria requires that operated fleets to become more efficient over time by linking eligibility to emissions performance below a certain threshold set to ensure substantially reduced emissions Thresholds are based on performance metrics vehicle km passenger km or tonne km They are mode specific and are linked to available testing methods where available They require efficiency improvements without being technology prescriptive so long as the benefits of relevant technologies can be demonstrated
1091,The operation of vehicles with zero tailpipe emissions or close to zero tailpipe emissions is automatically eligible in the proposed criteria Vehiclevessel electrification is the main category in this context This approach is also motivated by ETS inclusion and the ongoing decarbonisation of the EU power sector
1092,329 A Clean Planet for All A European longterm strategic vision for a prosperous modern competitive and climate neutral economy httpseceuropaeuclimasitesclimafilesdocspagescom_2018_733_analysis_in_support_en_0pdf
1093,330 The criteria developed is set with an EU focus due to its links to EU legislation and the European context in general It is acknowledged that for other regions the criteria proposed may not be applicable in defining substantial contributions to climate change mitigation
1094,The operation of vehicle fleets where fossil fuels are substituted with low or netzero carbon fuels such as advanced bio and synthetic fuels can make a substantial contribution to CO2 net emissions savings in the transport sector by enhancing climate neutral mobility332 333334335336337
1095,In the technical criteria below the TEG considers a role for low or netzero carbon fuels in four activities where they can offer substantial mitigation benefits and where commercialisation of zero tailpipe emissions vehicles or vessels is limited to date and where the operating conditions for the vehicles or vessels may slow the implementation of zero direct emissions alternatives including freight transport services by road interurban scheduled road transport services of passengers inland passenger water transport inland freight water transport The Clean Planet for All states that a variety of fuels and powertrains are likely to be needed for long haul heavy goods vehicles and long distance coaches Furthermore the Communication from the Commission on the European Green Deal sets out the need to to ramp up the production and deployment of sustainable alternative transport fuels In this context the Commission has committed to consider legislative options to boost the production and uptake of sustainable alternative fuels for the different transport modes As the taxonomy is developed in future to cover other activities sustainable alternative fuels such as advanced biofuels and electrofuels produced using renewable energy may also have a role to play eg in aviation and maritime shipping
1096,The proposed criteria limit their eligibility for use in certain modes and for dedicated fleets where it is understood that these fuels and the finance needed to support a shift can have a greater role to play from a climate mitigation perspective through the substitution of fossil fuels In addition it is noted in A Clean Planet for All that land constraints imply that biofuels and biomethane should be deployed only in those transport modes or means where they are necessary TEG notes that its important to ensure that these fuels are solely used to realise the maximum benefits of fuel substitution As such the criteria proposed also require a strict monitoring regime to ensure that these particular fuels are used However it is noted that blended fuels with very high levels of sustainable alternative fuels such as advanced biofuels and electrofuels produced using renewable energy biofuels may also offer climate mitigation benefits and could be considered by the Platform in future particularly in respect to aviation and shipping
1097,As an example of how this might work in practice a road freight transport operator may seek to operate a new or existing fleet of trucks solely using an eligible fuel eg advanced fuel To meet the Taxonomy criteria the operator would need to demonstrate through ongoing verification that the fleet was solely
1098,333 The CO2 emissions from the use of biofuels are not counted in the total GHG emissions from the transport sector in EUs official GHG inventory under the UNFCCC Without fuel substitution  the CO2 emissions from the transport sector would have been substantially higher
1099,334 A Clean Planet for All A European longterm strategic vision for a prosperous modern competitive and climate neutral economy httpseceuropaeuclimasitesclimafilesdocspagescom_2018_733_analysis_in_support_en_0pdf
1100,using biofuels as specified in the criteria A financier may be able to claim its investment eg in a new fleet was Taxonomy eligible through a contractual agreement with an operator to solely use biofuels also establishing a verification system to enable ongoing monitoring
1101,An important contribution to meeting GHG targets and reducing environmental pressures from the transport sector could come from a modal shift from aviation and road transport to rail and nonmotorised passenger transport as well as from road to rail and waterborne freight transport However modal shift is not included as a distinct economic activity with associated criteria in the proposed Taxonomy due to the complexities of capturing it in a robust unambiguous manner within the given Taxonomy architecture Instead the proposed Taxonomy acknowledges the potential carbon savings from a modal shift338 and therefore sets similar thresholds across modes which indirectly promotes modal shifts eg a greater proportion of fleets in lower carbon modes are Taxonomy eligible facilitating investment in these activities The relative emissions performance of modes will change over time as technologies evolve and uptake increases therefore the approach taken within the Taxonomy should be reviewed in the future
1102,The feedback received on TEGs report from June 2019 with regard to the transport sector was in general polarized with groups of respondents often advocating for technical criteria at opposite ends of the spectrum After careful consideration of all feedback no major revisions were made of the proposed substantial contribution criteria although criteria and rationales have been finetuned and further clarified where deemed necessary Feedback on DNSH criteria have been received for most modes of transport and has led to refinement and clarifications across the board
1103,The scope of economic activities and the type of criteria proposed in this section may help to inform the design of technical criteria for the transport sector beyond the EU However the quantitative thresholds proposed are EU focused by design given the EU taxonomy regulation itself but also because they are based on EU legal reference points
1104,Detailed guidance should be established to assist in interpretation and implementation of the taxonomy For transport specific guidance will be required for how to undertake exante assessments on utilisation of transport for example to establish if passengerkm or tonnekm criteria are met The following is a proposed guidance on methods for undertaking such assessments and are presented in order of preference because the likely accuracy of resulting data
1105,At this stage there are other activities in the transport sector that have not been addressed but which need consideration as part of further work on the Taxonomy eg by the Platform on Sustainable Finance
1106,currently limited to advanced biofuels as per Article 2 34 of the EU Renewable Energy Directive II Directive EU 20182001 For other types of biofuels that are not advanced biofuels but may offer substantial climate mitigation benefits the TEG request that the Platform undertake further work to consider establishing criteria for ensuring substantial contribution to climate mitigation
1107,Maritime shipping has been considered by the TEG Whilst it was evident that zero direct emissions fleets should be eligible as for other modes criteria will also need to be established for short sea shipping where modal shift benefits can be achieved Furthermore it will be also important to consider approaches to maritime shipping based on the efficiency of transport fleets Discussions in this area were not concluded during the timeframe of the TEG and should be continued in further work on the Taxonomy Aviation was not considered within the scope of the work of the TEG but should be addressed in the future considering the significance of emissions from the sector In addition ICT transport specific solutions and transport demand management can be important measures for enabling mitigation that have not been included at this stage but warrant further study
1108,The threshold of 50 gCO2epkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor 50 gCO2vkm and significantly lower than emissions for an average car in the current vehicle stock
1109,emissions for an average car in the current vehicle stock 290 gCO2 vkm339 This means that diesel passenger rail transport emission activities will only be eligible when the carbon intensity of the vehicle divided by the number of actual passengers is similar to eligible low carbon road transport vehicles activity 245 The criteria is based on actual ridership passengerkm and not capacity offered seat km or placeskm This should be justified through real monitoring data from operations or exante demand assessments The current average for EU diesel rail is 7090 g CO2 pkm340 so the threshold is stringent enough to screen out most of the rail systems based on diesel operating in Europe as the load factor would need to be higher than 60 to reach eligibility However it would still enable certain hybrid systems of high efficiency to be eligible
1110,The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the operation of rail transport activities are attributed to air pollution noise and vibration water use Direct emissions of air pollutants are not an issue of concern in the case of electrified rail but only where very efficient diesel or hybrid engines would meet the CO2ethreshold defined to ensure substantial mitigation of GHG emissions

1114,Zero direct emissions trains eg electric hydrogen are eligible   Other trains are eligible if direct emissions per tonnekm gCO2etkm are 50 lower than average reference CO2 emissions of HDVs as defined for the Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation to be reviewed in 2025
1115,The threshold of 50 lower than average reference CO2 emissions of HDVs  ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road freight vehicles with a review in 2025 to assess technology developments in the freight transport sector The Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation uses a g CO2km metric To convert this to a g CO2tonnekm metric the average payload for the road freight vehicles should be applied Once reference value data is available it is expected that the taxonomy will specify CO2etkm threshold values
1116,The carbon intensity of freight rail even if diesel is in most cases significantly lower than road freight transport rail freight transport at least meeting the threshold proposed in the road transport HDV criteria is eligible Average direct emissions for diesel rail is in the range of 1840 g CO2
1117,Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change and therefore is excluded A percentage of fossil fuels transported was considered as a threshold but following feedback from experts it is considered difficult to implement a  threshold because for example it is not easily known particularly exante how locomotives will be used
1118,The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from the operation of rail transport activities are attributed to air pollution noise and vibration pollution and water use Direct emissions of air pollutants are not an issue of concern in the case of electrified rail but only where very efficient diesel or hybrid engines would meet the CO2ethreshold defined to ensure substantial mitigation of GHG emissions

1124,a bus in the EU is 7090 g CO2 epkm344 with load factors of around 10 passengers per bus with the variation dependent on a number of considerations such as public service obligations type of service etc As per current average technology a hybrid bus would require at least 16 passenger average occupation factor and diesel more than 20 passengers to be eligible This threshold is therefore stringent while it provides some flexibility to recognize highly efficient systems and advanced hybrid technology
1125,Diesel and petrol cars still represent the immense majority of the road fleet in all countries and the penetration of electric vehicles will materialize at a yet unknown pace In the meanwhile a lack of investment in public transport fleet renewal can lead to behavioural changes such as modal shift to private car that would be significantly more difficult to revert in the future345
1126,344 The consumption factors per vehkm are based on Copert The average consumption factor is made up of a ratio between urban rural and motorway which is typical for an urban bus according to the Copert data 1218 MJkm The EU average km weighted occupation of a standard bus is 89 persons STREAM 2016 does not represent emissions per seatkm capacity but actual emissions per passengerkm thus taking into account not only the technological component but also the operational efficiency of the system

1136,Infrastructure that is required for zero direct emissions transport eg electric charging points electricity grid connection upgrades hydrogen fuelling stations or electric highways  Infrastructure and equipment including fleets for active mobility walking cycling ebikes and escooters  Infrastructure that is predominantly used for lowcarbon transport if the fleet that uses the infrastructure meets the thresholds for direct emissions as defined in the relevant activity  measured in CO2 emissions per kilometre gCO2km CO2e emissions per tonnekilometre gCO2etkm or CO2e emissions per passengerkilometre gCO2epkm
1137,the uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy Eligibility for infrastructure is linked to eligibility criteria for fleets using the infrastructure with additional criteria relating to zero carbon transport active mobility
1138,The construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon land transport is considered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy
1139,Criteria 3 above would accommodate all electric rail lines and nonelectrified lines with battery powered and hydrogen trains operating However even if nonelectrified there might be a case for renewal of rail infrastructure in order to ensure continuity of the service while alternative powered trains hydrogen battery are deployed in the future years hence the inclusion of criteria 4 above There is no significant risk of lockin in those cases where the fleet is due for renewal
1140,In criteria 3 above predominantly used for should be interpreted to mean that the majority of the use of the infrastructure is by fleets meeting the substantial contribution criteria in other land transport activities identified in the taxonomy Where there may be greater uncertainty in fleet use eg estimations based on future projections a more conservative approach should be applied to ensure that the predominant use requirement will be met
1141,There is requirement that only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transport service is eligible Infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation are those infrastructure that are needed to ensure the daytoday delivery of a transport service eg tracks IT equipment ensuring service delivery ticket offices and fleet maintenance facilities It does not include ancillary infrastructure that do not directly ensure delivery of the operation of the fleet eg head offices of the transport operator
1142,For the criteria that infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossil fuels is not eligible the term dedicated is defined as infrastructure being built and acquired with the explicit intention to transport or store fossil fuels even if actual use may serve other purposes as well
1143,It is acknowledged that embedded carbon emissions in infrastructure projects eg upstream emissions from manufacture of construction materials may be significant in certain circumstances The level of uncertainty around data in this respect makes it challenging at this time to incorporate this consideration within thresholds for infrastructure However this element should be considered for ongoing work on the Taxonomy Transport of fossil fuels is considered to have potential negative impacts on climate change and therefore is excluded
1144,ICT infrastructure meeting the criteria above is eligible ie it meets one of the stated criteria and is fundamental to the operation of the transport service However it is recognised that wider ICT activities in transport may have substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and this will require future work to define criteria
1145,The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from infrastructure activities are attributed to noise and vibration pollution water contamination waste generation and impacts on biodiversity habitat and wildlife and land use consumption with ecosystem impacts specifically
1146,areas or areas of high biodiversity values outside protected areas  Infrastructure can cause fragmentation and degradation of the natural and urban landscape due to the barrier effects of the infrastructure and can involve risks of wildlife accidents caused by collisions Railway infrastructure in particular tunnels can cause change and degradation of hydromorphological conditions of water bodies and therefore have impacts on aquatic ecosystems
1147,Identify and manage risks related to water quality andor water consumption at the appropriate level Ensure that water useconservation management plans developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders have been developed and implemented
1148,demolition waste excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list generated on the construction site must be prepared for reuse recycling and other material recovery including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials This can be achieved by executing the construction works in line with the good practice guidance laid down in the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol354
1149,Environmental Impact Assessment EIA has been completed in accordance with EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment 201452EU and Strategic Environmental Assessment 200142EC or other equivalent national provisions
1150,mitigate any potential negative impacts of the designated activities projects or assets on ecosystems and its biodiversity and should be assessed and conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Habitats and Birds  Directives
1151,Invasive plants are appearing very often along transport infrastructure and are sometimes even spread duo to transport infrastructure which might negatively impact natural ecosystems eg natural fauna Care should be taken not to spread any invasive plants through proper maintenance
1152,Brief rationale Zero direct emissions vehicles eg electric hydrogen are eligible because the generation of the energy carriers used by zero tailpipe emissions vehicles is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future
1153,Vehicles with tailpipe emission intensity of max 50 g CO2km WLTP are eligible until 2025 because the post2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans sets this threshold as an ambitious midterm target that is significantly below the expected average emissions of new cars and vans The 50 g CO2km threshold does not apply to L vehicles eg motorcycles due to their lower weight and high electrification potential
1154,This activity includes operation of all vehicles classified as M1 N1 as defined by Regulation EU 2018858 and of vehicles classified as category L 2 and 3wheel vehicles and quadricycles as defined in Regulation EU No 1682013 It also applies to NACE code 4932 Taxi operation NACE code 5310 Postal activities under universal service obligation NACE code 5320 Other postal and courier activities and NACE 7711 Rental and leasing of cars and light motor vehicles where these activities may include the operation of eligible vehicles

1158,The revised Directive includes ambitious and binding procurement targets for each EU member state using harmonized definition what a cleanvehicle is The notion of cleanvehicle is principally aligned with aim of the Taxonomy and the proposed Art 61c above The transition element is also built into the CVD  The relevant definitions for light duty vehicles are aligned with the post2020 CO2 Regulation for cars and vans Taken together these two pieces of EU legislation reflect the latest thinking on ambitious and sufficiently mature performance metrics The potential for synergies is significant when the Taxonomy is aligned to the legislative thresholds for clean vehicles It will reduce market uncertainty in terms of what are green vehicles to manufacture and operate both from the demand and supply side
1159,The Clean Vehicles Directive acknowledges that lifecycle and welltowheel emission are to be addressed at a later point in time recital 31 The possible reflection of life cycle CO2 emissions and of welltowheel CO2 emissions of vehicles for the period after 2030 should be considered taking into account relevant provisions of Union law for their calculation at that point in time
1160,By 31 December 2027 the Commission should review the implementation of Directive 200933EC In its review the Commission should also assess inter alia the possibility of aligning this Clean Vehicles Directive to any methodology for counting lifecycle CO2 emissions and welltowheel CO2 emissions developed in the context of EU vehicle CO2 emission performance standards
1161,The Commission shall no later than 2023 evaluate the possibility of developing a common Union methodology for the assessment and the consistent data reporting of the full lifecycle CO2 emissions of light duty vehicles that are placed on the Union market The Commission shall transmit that evaluation including where appropriate proposals for followup measures such as legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council
1162,Vehicles must comply with the emission thresholds for clean lightduty vehicles in Table 2 in the Annex of Directive EU 20191161 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 amending Directive 200933EC on the promotion of clean and energyefficient road transport vehicles
1163,Tyres must comply with the revised Tyre labelling regulation355 It includes noise labelling requirements but not requirements on tyre abrasion However the proposal of revision envisages a test method to be developed A suitable testing method to measure tyre abrasion is not currently available Therefore the Commission should mandate the development of such a method taking into full consideration all stateof theart internationally developed or proposed standards or regulations with a view to establishing a suitable testing method as soon as possible  Tyres must comply with the noise requirements set by Regulation EC No 6612009 on typeapproval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles356

1166,Brief rationale Road freight transport with zero direct emissions vehicles eg electric hydrogen is eligible because the generation of these energy carriers is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future The definition is aligned with the heavy duty CO2 regulation which provides the most recent legislative point of orientation Road freight transport with lowemission heavy duty vehicles defined in the same regulation and dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowly defined range of bio or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relatively high challenges in electrifying this vehicle category Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line with the agreed taxonomy regulation
1167,This activity includes operation of vehicles classified as N2 and N3 vehicles as defined by REGULATION EU 2018858 It also applies to NACE code 5310 Postal activities under universal service obligation and NACE code 5320 Other postal and courier activities where these activities may include the operation of eligible vehicles

1171,zero emission heavyduty vehicle means a heavyduty vehicle without an internal combustion engine or with an internal combustion engine that emits less than 1g CO2kWh or 1g CO2km for certain N2 vehicles
1172,Lowemission heavyduty vehicle means a heavyduty vehicle which is not a zero emission heavy duty vehicle with specific CO2 emissions of half of the reference CO2 emissions of all vehicles in the subgroup to which the heavyduty vehicle belongs The reference CO2 emissions shall be based on the monitoring data reported pursuant to Regulation EU 2018956 for the period from 1 July 2019 to 30 June 2020
1173,Heavy Duty CO2 Regulation Recital 42358 It is important to assess the full lifecycle emissions from heavyduty vehicles at EU level To this end the Commission should no later than 2023 evaluate the possibility of developing a common Union methodology for the assessment and the consistent data reporting of the full lifecycle CO2 emissions of heavyduty vehicles that are placed on the Union market The Commission should adopt followup measures including where appropriate legislative proposals
1174,By contrast to light duty vehicles the electrification of trucks is currently limited to small demonstration fleets Especially for heavy trucks for regional and longhaul operations fuel substitution to advanced
1175,The operation of vehicle fleets where fossil fuels are substituted with low or netzero carbon fuels such as advanced bio and synthetic fuels can make a substantial contribution to CO2 net emissions savings in the transport sector360361362363 This criteria only applies for vehicles that have a specified minimum level of efficiency The criteria for producing these fuels are set elsewhere in the Taxonomy
1176,As an example of how this might work in practice a road freight transport operator may seek to operate a new or existing fleet of trucks solely using an eligible fuel eg advanced fuel To meet the Taxonomy criteria the operator would need to demonstrate through ongoing verification that the fleet was solely using biofuels as specified in the criteria A financier may be able to claim its investment eg in a new fleet was Taxonomy eligible through a contractual agreement with an operator to solely use biofuels also establishing a verification system to enable ongoing monitoring

1182,Brief rationale Passenger transport with zero tailpipe emissions vehicles eg electric hydrogen is eligible because the generation of these energy carriers is assumed to become low or zero carbon in the near future Dedicated vehicles solely using a narrowly defined range of bio or other renewable fuels are also eligible due to the relatively high challenges in electrifying the vehicle category typically used on interurban routes Substantial contribution to climate mitigation from fuel substitution is in line with the agreed taxonomy regulation The threshold of 50gCO2epkm relates to the thresholds set for passenger cars assuming occupancy of one and represents a value that is significantly below average new car emissions
1183,The threshold of 50 gCO2epkm until 2025 ensures that the carbon intensity remains similar to criteria for eligible road vehicles with low occupation factor 50 gCO2vkm and significantly lower than average diesel car 290 gCO2vkm367 The criteria is based on actual ridership passengerkm and not capacity offered seatkm or placeskm This should be justified through real monitoring data from operations or exante demand assessments
1184,Unlike urban buses zero tailpipe emission vehicle technologies are not commercially available therefore the threshold should be reviewed in or prior to 2025 rather than specifying now that only zero direct emissions will be eligible at that point to analyze the modal shift comparison with cars in interurban transport and technology developments in the sector
1185,With no commercial availability of zero tailpipe emission vehicles for this activity fuel substitution to advanced biofuels and renewable synthetic fuels are considered a relevant mitigation option for some transport modes in the medium term as identified in the EC Long term strategy368

1221,Infrastructure that is required for zero direct emissions water transport eg batteries or hydrogen fuelling facilities is eligible Infrastructure dedicated to supporting the renewable energy sector  Infrastructure that is predominantly used for lowcarbon transport is eligible if the fleet that uses the infrastructure meets the thresholds for direct emissions as defined in the relevant activity  measured in CO2e emissions per passengerkilometre gCO2epkmper tonnekilometre gCO2etkm per passenger nautical mile gCO2epnm or per tonne nautical mile gCO2etnm 396
1222,Brief rationale The construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon water transport is considered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the transport activities that are considered eligible under the rest of the land transport section of the Taxonomy Eligibility for infrastructure is linked to
1223,396 At this stage only criteria for inland waterway transport passenger and freight fleets are defined The criteria for infrastructure could not be applied to nonzero direct emissions maritime shipping fleets until criteria for that type of activity is defined
1224,The construction and operation of infrastructure for low carbon water transport is considered eligible because this is considered a key enabling factor for improving the uptake of the activities considered eligible under the rest of the water transport section of the Taxonomy
1225,In criteria 3 above predominantly used for should be interpreted to mean that the majority of the use of the infrastructure is by fleets meeting the substantial contribution criteria in other water transport activities identified in the taxonomy Where there may be greater uncertainty in fleet use eg estimations based on future projections a more conservative approach should be applied to ensure that the predominant use requirement will be met
1226,There is requirement that only infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation of the transport service is eligible Infrastructure that is fundamental to the operation are those infrastructure that are needed to ensure the daytoday delivery of a transport service eg fuellingcharging facilities It does not include ancillary infrastructure that do not directly ensure delivery of the operation of the fleet eg head offices of the transport operator
1227,For the criteria that infrastructure that is dedicated to the transport of fossil fuels or blended fossil fuels is not eligible the term dedicated is defined as infrastructure being built and acquired with the explicit intention to transport or store fossil fuels even if actual use may serve other purposes as well
1228,It is acknowledged that embedded carbon emissions in infrastructure projects eg upstream emissions from manufacture of construction materials can be significant The level of uncertainty around data in this respect makes it challenging at this time to incorporate this consideration within thresholds for infrastructure However this element should be considered for ongoing work on the Taxonomy
1229,ICT infrastructure meeting the criteria above is eligible ie it meets one of the stated criteria and is fundamental to the operation of the transport service However it is recognised that wider ICT activities in transport may have substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and this will require future work to define criteria
1230,The main potential significant harm to other environmental objectives from water infrastructure activities are attributed to the alteration of hydromorphology due to dredging maintenance activities and construction of new infrastructures and waterways as well as impact on biodiversity and ecosystems from such activities
1231,At least 80 by weight of the nonhazardous construction and demolition waste excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list generated on the construction site must be prepared for reuse recycling and other material recovery including backfilling operations using waste to substitute other materials This can be achieved by executing the construction works in line with the good practice guidance laid down in the EU Construction and Demolition Waste Management Protocol397
1232,Environmental Impact Assessment EIA has been completed in accordance with EU Directives on Environmental Impact Assessment 201452EU and Strategic Environmental Assessment 200142EC or other equivalent national provisions
1233,mitigate any potential negative impacts of the designated activities projects or assets on ecosystems and its biodiversity and should be assessed and conducted in compliance with the provisions of the EU Habitats and Birds  Directives including the Marine Strategy Framework Directive as well as the Water Framework Directive in particular ensuring conditions outlined in article 47 of the WFD are met
1234,Analysis by the European Commissions Joint Research Centre JRC on the EU ICT sector398  based on 2015 data  assesses that its Value Added amounted to 581 billion euros it employed 58 million people spent 30 billion euros on RD and represented 39 of the EU value added 25 of total employment and 157 of total RD The ICT service sector in particular represented 36 of GDP In general the ICT sector in 2015 was more dynamic than the whole EU economy as value added increased 52 employment 18 and RD 29
1235,However based on the estimates published by the European Framework Initiative for Energy  Environmental Efficiency in the ICT Sector399 ICT currently accounts for 810 of the European electricity consumption
1236,The demand for telecommunications services is consistently growing It IP traffic data through telecom networks has been estimated to be growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR of 26 percent from 2017 to 2022400
1237,The JRC estimated total annual energy consumption of data centres in Western Europe as 56 TWh or 2 of the total electricity consumption per year In 2012 this was projected to increase to 104 TWh or 4 per year by 2020 The large consumption of energy is due to the need for permanent storage of data 24 hour availability backup generators etc and the need for cooling of the servers and other equipment to maintain optimal operating temperatures401
1238,Considering this economic activitys dependence on electricity in a longterm scenario of decarbonized but limited energy from the grid the sector mitigation potential has been identified in high standards of energy efficiency rather than in low carbon footprints
1239,Given the complexity of data centres  which encompass hardware software cooling systems monitoring and backup energy systems only to name a few components  and the tradeoffs that are present in the industry between energy efficiency and reliability and security the TEG has opted for a comprehensive approach setting as threshold for significant contribution to mitigation a data centre compliance with the more advanced standard of energy efficiency available for this sector the Best Practice Guidelines for the EU Code of Conduct on Data Centre Energy Efficiency JRC updated every year by the Commission to take account of technological advances402
1240,Despite the almost negligible contribution to the economy data driven solution for data collection transmission and modelling of GHG emissions reductionsrelated information plays an important enabling role Given the nature of the activity no threshold are necessary
1241,The International Energy Agency IEA 403has developed two different electricity demand and energy efficiency scenarios for data transmission networks fixedmobile in 2021 The first scenario assumes a moderate rate of improvement in energy efficiency of 10 per year which is close to conservative estimates of historical improvements and the other assumes a more rapid rate of improvement of 20 per year In the moderate efficiencyimprovement scenario the midpoint of the electricity demand range in 2021 rises by over 70 to about 320 TWh
1242,To ensure significant contribution to climate change mitigation the TEG has considered setting a threshold in terms of energy efficiency for each type of communication network based on environmental and energy efficiency standard as set by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI404  which fully take into account the complexity and diversity of telecommunication networks The recommended threshold would be set at the top 10  meaning that only the networks belonging to the top decile in their category for energy efficiency would qualify as Taxonomyeligible
1243,This bestin class approach is different from the incremental or mitigation approach advocated by a few stakeholders who recommend defining significant contribution in terms of incremental improvement in energy efficiency compared to a previous baseline at every company For example a move from 4G to 5G  which implies a 15 improvement in energy efficiency  would qualify for the definition of significant contribution to mitigation
1244,Considering the potential use of the taxonomy this approach would not be helpful for investors who need to compare equity investments and need to benchmark companies against each other and not against a previous state
1245,Based on this alternative approach threshold should for example be set in terms of attaining at least 15 energy saving compared to the energy consumption measured before the eligible project was implemented

1248,The energy efficiency of software and programming languages is an emerging area of research which is starting to grab the attention of academics405 The TEG recommends that the Commission develop a code of conduct similar to the one published for data centres to ensure that best practices are identified and standards adopted by the software industry
1249,Defined as development andor use of integrated systems ie combination of software and hardware or software applications that minimize resource consumption in other sectors of the economy these digitilasion solution are essential to ensure that other sectors of the economy  agriculture energy transport buildings  meet the eligibility criteria set for other sectors inclusion in the EU Taxonomy
1250,Stakeholders have also flagged the possibility to use avoided emissions to inform thresholds However in the absence of established benchmarks for the accounting of avoided emissions for these sectors as part of the EU PEF and OEF harmonised methodology for the calculation of the environmental footprint of products and organisations methods this should be left to future iterations of the Taxonomy
1251,406 Further examples mentioned by stakeholders include services based on connectivity the Internet of Things IoT Cloud or Big Data can lead to a more efficient use of energy and can contribute to mitigating climate change effects through  improving the efficiency of farming methods and increasing yields  more effective monitoring and management of electricity use heating and cooling  enabling a more efficient distributed system of low carbon energy generation and smart grids  using smart devices or digital services that enable individuals to have lower carbon lifestyles  improving logistics vehicle use vehicle efficiency and use of public transportation  enabling more effective remote working or education thus avoiding travel and commuting  and even through the replacement of physical products by digital services
1252,This implies Implementation of the practices  including relevant optional ones where reasonable  described in the most recent Best Practice Guidelines for the European Code of Conduct for Data Centre Energy Efficiency  JRC or in CENCENELEC documents CLC TR50600991 and CLC TR50600992
1253,Rationale for energy efficiency versus emission reduction as mitigation principle low or zero emissions can be achieved by sourcing electricity from renewable sources from the grid or on site Given the mounting competition for renewable energy an expected greening of the energy system and the projected growth of electricity consumption deriving from the digitalisation of the economy inclusion in the Taxonomy will only depend on energy efficiency

1255,Development andor use of ICT solutions that are aimed at collecting transmitting storing data and at its modelling and use when these activities are exclusively aimed at the provision of data and analytics for decision making by the public and private sector enabling GHG emission reductions
1256,The option to adopt a threshold for multipurpose solutions eg 50 of activity has to be applied to climate change has been considered but turned down not to incur behavioural issues related to the lack of control over the use of the data and analytics by the end user
1257,Example Advanced weather forecasting models tailored to integrating more renewables in electricity generation Digital technologies such as machinelearning algorithms when applied to weather and power plant output data can increase the accuracy of renewable forecasts to up to 94 from around 88 across the industry
1258,In the EU buildings are effectively the largest energy consuming sector responsible for around 40 of energy consumption and 36 of carbon emissions407 At the same time embodied carbon emissions are increasing and receiving growing attention About threequarters of European buildings are considered inefficient while only 0412 depending on the country of the building stock is renovated each year to improve its efficiency408 Renovation rates must be increased in order to set the whole building stock on a netzero emissions pathway while embodied and operational carbon emissions of new buildings must be significantly reduced in order to minimise their impact over their life cycle At the same time designing and renovating buildings to high energy performance standards is not sufficient to ensure low carbon emissions during operations thus more needs to be done to address the performance gap409 of efficient buildings Within this context the TEG acknowledged the need for an ambitious approach and the crucial role that the taxonomy can play in directing financial flows towards the decarbonisation of the built environment
1259,The taxonomy distinguishes four economic activities and defines consistent mitigation criteria that enable assessing the eligibility of investments in construction and real estate on the basis of their potential impact on building energy performance and thus carbon emissions The four activities are designed to be relevant to most real estate market participants and facilitate investment flows to mitigation measures in the building sector
1260,410 Certain types of financial instruments such as loans for acquisition and renovation of buildings may need to consider acquisition costs integrally with the eligible renovation costs if these costs cannot be practically separated in those types of financial instruments
1261,Individual measures and professional services this activity covers technical interventions aimed at increasing energy efficiency and professional services that are functional to energy improvements and enables accounting of
1262,The lack of consistent and comparable data across countries for benchmarking building stock performance and setting suitable thresholds for the top performing buildings within the respective national stock
1263,The inherent difficulty of creating a level playing field across countries with different climates and degrees of market readiness Compared to other economic activities the operation of individual buildings has unique characteristics which means the performance of different assets cannot easily be compared Due to climatic differences across regions buildings in different locations have different energy needs for heating air conditioning and lighting and therefore different potential to contribute to climate change mitigation Furthermore the nature of the existing building stock varies significantly from country to country and even from region to region due to differences in design construction techniques and building age
1264,The desire to find a compromise between rising ambition and building upon already existing green financing instruments The financing of buildings and building energy improvements is the most developed segment of the green finance market and the ownership of buildings in portfolios is an extensively practiced economic activity As the Taxonomy is introduced to the market it is important to maintain the volume of existing investors and enable them to use the Taxonomy to evaluate their portfolios
1265,The intention to direct finance towards new buildings designed to higher standards than mandatory design and construction requirements considering the varying levels of ambition and rigor regarding the implementation of nearly zeroenergy buildings NZEB across EU Member States 411
1266,Setting criteria for new constructions to raise above mandatory design requirements and progress towards netzero emissions in the use phase by 2030 and work to introduce a requirement on including embodied carbon
1267,Adopting a bestinclass approach to ensure that the acquisition and ownership criteria support both significant market uptake and sufficient environmental benefits Encouraging buyers to acquire efficient buildings over lessefficient ones can also provide an opportunity to support substantial contribution to climate mitigation by increasing the demand for such buildings and by enabling buyers to consume less energy during the use phase The TEG considers that the bestinclass approach can be approximated by benchmarking the top performing 15 of the existing national stock This performance level is intended to decline following 2050 decarbonisation targets The performance of the top performing 15of the national stock needs to be transposed into absolute energy or carbon metrics but the TEG considered that data is not yet adequately available
1268,Requiring improvements over time to ensure overall stock decarbonisation The TEG is aware that there will be limited longterm impact in terms of emission reductions if the market simply trades financial exposure in the top 15 of national stocks without improving the energy efficiency of such buildings through renovation In fact there may be a risk of undermining renovation efforts if financing acquisition becomes less onerous than financing energy efficiency measures For this reason the TEG recommends introducing a requirement to renovate assets that are acquired though financial instruments that have long tenure periods
1269,1 Construction of new buildings to be eligible the design and construction of new buildings needs to ensure a net primary energy demand that is at least 20 lower than the level mandated by national regulations This is assessed through the calculated energy performance of the building ie performance forecasted on the basis of modelling building physics under typical climatic and occupancy conditions
1270,This criterion is meant to be subject to reviews in the transitional decade 20202030 in order to take into account potential tightening of NZEB requirements by EU Member States with the aim of setting the whole sector on convergence towards netzero energy and carbon targets by 2030
1271,2 Building renovations renovations designed to meet the local national or regional requirements for major renovation as defined in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive EPBD412 this will stimulate the market and encourage building owners undertaking a conventional renovation to include energyefficiency measures established by EU Member States in national and regional regulations implementing the EPBD  In alternative renovations are eligible if undertaken to ensure at least 30 savings in net primary energy demand in comparison to the baseline energy performance of the building before the renovation assessed through the calculated energy performance of the building  Individual measures and professional services measures and services aimed at reducing energy andor carbon emissions in buildings This is assessed through technical requirements for each measure and service
1272,4 Acquisition and ownership buildings built after 2021 are eligible if they meet the criteria for the Construction of new buildings while buildings built before 2021 are eligible if their performance is comparable to the performance of the top 15 of the national stock in terms of calculated Primary Energy Demand during the use phase An additional requirement is applied only to large non residential buildings built both before and after 2021 to ensure efficient operations through energy management
1273,With regards to the criteria established for Do No Significant Harm DNSH to the other 5 environmental objectives in the interest of practicality and ease of market application the TEG has opted to rely on EU policy and regulations when possible The TEG is conscious that the DNSH criteria to climate change adaptation requires extensive clarification in terms of its implementation in practice
1274,Except for buildings used for the extraction storage transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels the taxonomy does not exclude any particular type of building and therefore covers virtually the whole market for construction and real estate activities413 This does not mean that every activity will be eligible only that any participant in the market can use the taxonomy to assess the eligibility of hisher investments related to buildings
1275,The Mitigation criteria will impact EU Member States differently as the share of the market eligible under the taxonomy will vary from location to location due to differences in the levels of ambition established by national regulations definition of NZEB and minimum energy performance requirements and implementation of the EPBD for new and existing buildings undergoing and renovations Buildings in countries with a highly decarbonised electricity grid will have an inherent advantage in delivering netzero carbon buildings
1276,For renovations differences in the minimum energy performance requirements set for major renovations across EU Member States imply that the Mitigation criteria will be easier to meet in some countries However it should be considered that requirements for major renovations have been established by Member States on the basis of local climatic and building stock conditions as well as costoptimality calculations and will be to be updated in the future
1277,Outside the EU the share of the market that could be eligible will also vary from country to country Countries with ambitious building regulations that are accepted as taxonomyequivalent will more easily be able to make large shares of their market eligible The principle of the top performing 15 of the national stock provides a methodology to demonstrate eligibility of the nonEU best in class building stock
1278,For renovations the 30 energy savings threshold alternative to the compliance with major renovation requirements will not only facilitate immediate functionality of the taxonomy outside the EU it will also make a significant part of renovation activities eligible even in countries where national building regulations may not be ambitious enough Moreover the share of the market that could be eligible outside EU Member States will also depend on the local proliferation of taxonomyeligible sustainability certification schemes
1279,Uptake if the taxonomy among market participants will have both beneficial and adverse effects on the sector By enabling owners and developers to access dedicated green financial instruments the taxonomy will stimulate much needed investment in the renovation of buildings with lower levels of energy performance as the well as construction of new energyefficient buildings and the efficient operation of existing buildings Market participants who do not upgrade their practices in line with taxonomy criteria may lose competitiveness and the ability to brand their economic activities and products as green The TEG acknowledges the risk of creating stranded assets but considers that by creating different paths to accessing finance sufficient safeguards have been included in the criteria to adequately manage this possibility
1280,In terms of implementation costs the taxonomy will affect market participants differently Meeting eligibility criteria for new constructions renovations and acquisitions may result in additional costs in comparison to businessasusual practices These additional costs can be counterbalanced over time through the expected energy savings and the wider benefits on health comfort lower volume of energy consumption and reduced energy bills etc associated with highperforming buildings Market participants may also incur further costs due to the process required to demonstrate eligibility with taxonomy criteria especially when the latter are based on several technical parameters However these parameters have been largely based on international standards and EU regulations to take into account usability issues considering also the differences between the residential and commercial sectors
1281,Overall considering the importance and urgency of improving the energy performance and decarbonising the building stock the impact of implementation costs can be considered proportionate to the goals of the taxonomy especially as successful taxonomy uptake will also have significant positive social and economic impacts Requiring high standards for new buildings and renovating existing ones will reduce energy bills and improve indoor air quality and thermal comfort positively impacting occupants health and available income Requiring high standards will also stimulate the demand for sustainability professionals service providers and skilled construction workers thus creating employment and upskilling opportunities The eligibility of individual measures and professional services will also boost the market for energy efficiency
1282,lowcarbon technologies and related services Eligibility of measures such as the installation of electric vehicle charging stations will facilitate an integrated crosssectoral approach with the transport sector
1283,The TEG acknowledges the need to review and update the criteria identified in this report and encourages the Sustainable Finance Platform to agree on a timeline for this purpose Consistency of criteria across the four activities should be maintained in future iterations of the taxonomy
1284,The Sustainable Finance Platform should establish a timeline for reviewing the 20 relative improvement from NZEB requirements which applies to the Construction of new buildings in conjunction with the expected updates of NZEB regulations by EU Member States and with the clear objective of converging towards netzero energy and netzero carbon targets for new buildings by 2030 Such targets are aligned with the strategies of the World Green Building Council414 the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction415 and other organisations416 Buildings built between 2021 and 2050 will represent up to 23 of the total stock in 2050 417 If the entire stock is meant to be netzero carbon by 2050 it follows that those buildings built between 2021 and 2050 must be netzero carbon in order for the overall target to be met The sooner new buildings are built with netzero performance the less difficult it will be to meet the 2050 target for the whole sector to be netzero Since the TEG recommends working towards the introduction of netzero carbon only after 2030 this already constitutes a compromise between the urgent need to eliminate emissions from new constructions and the capacity of the real estate sector to deliver netzero carbon buildings
1285,Where netzero carbon is already mandated by regulation as may be the case for some building types in some Member States the taxonomy should not require better performance since net zero carbon can be considered sufficient from the side of new constructions to allow the entire building stock to be climateneutral by 2050
1286,growing among built environment professionals while methods and tools for embodied carbon assessment based on LCA are becoming more widespread Notably a large share of emissions embodied in buildings takes place during resource extraction and product manufacturing before buildings are even occupied which means that all new constructions begin their lifecycle with a significant amount of embodied carbon
1287,The Sustainable Finance Platform should gather and analyse existing data in order to establish reliable thresholds for carbon emission embodied in new constructions which will be integrated into the taxonomy criteria for the activity Construction of new buildings as additional threshold to be met These thresholds should be based on a wide and consistent set of data suitable for benchmarking best practice across different building uses and typologies ie houses flats offices etc thus the Sustainable Finance Platform should encourage and support the generation of such data The Sustainable Finance Platform should progress this work with the aim of introducing thresholds for embodied carbon by 2025  In parallel the methodology adopted to assess embodied emissions should be defined in detail with reference to widely accepted LCA and CENTC350 standards with particular attention towards adequately recognising the beneficial impact of carbon sequestration in timber products sourced from sustainably managed forests
1288,By the end of 2024 the Sustainable Finance Platform should establish absolute thresholds for energy and carbon emissions to represent the performance of the top 15 of national stocks and provide a clear decarbonisation pathway as threshold for assessing the acquisition and ownership of assets built before 2021 By then the performance of the top 15 of each national stock will have been converted into absolute thresholds for energy and carbon emissions Until 31 December 2025 the top 15 of the national stock represents the performance level required to be eligible From that date onward and every five years afterwards the performance level should be lowered to reflect a pathway reaching netzero operational carbon in 2050 Such pathway could look as follows
1289,The Sustainable Finance Platform should consider how to address longterm eligibility ie assets covered by financial instruments with a tenure period of ten years or more These assets could be required to be renovated in order to maintain eligibility For example there could be a requirement for renovations to occur within 15 years from the acquisition date
1290,The Sustainable Finance Platform should provide guidance on the practical implementation of the DNSH criteria to climate change adaptation especially for the activity of building renovation taking into account the need to avoid disproportionate administrative and financial burden
1291,considering different building typologies Emissions due to unregulated energy use are not currently covered by the criteria established in this report but these emissions can represent a significant share of the operational impact of buildings especially from specific nonresidential typologies To shorten the process and avoid the duplication of efforts these thresholds could be developed on the basis of the decarbonisation trajectories identified in the research project Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor CRREM funded by Horizon 2020
1292,The Sustainable Finance Platform should develop appropriate criteria and thresholds to address Scope 1 emissions of construction companies ie emission that are associated with the operation of such firms and the associated construction works
1293,The construction of new buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by saving large part of the energy and carbon emissions that would be associated with conventionally designed buildings
1294,Condition for noneligibility to avoid lockin and undermining the climate mitigation objective the construction of new buildings designed for the purpose of extraction storage transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels is not eligible
1295,Use of alternative schemes as proxies outside EU Member States established schemes such as green building certifications or building regulations and standards may be used as alternative proof of eligibility provided that this is verified by the Sustainable Finance Platform The organisation responsible for the scheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting evidence that a specific level of certificationregulation can be considered equivalent or superior to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold for the relevant climatic zone and building type The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application
1296,The metric is Primary Energy Demand PED defining the energy performance of a building the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building lifecycle ie module B6 as defined in EN15978 calculated exante according to the national methodologies for asset design assessment or as defined in the set of standards ISO 52000 expressed as kWhm2 per year The threshold is based on nearly zeroenergy building NZEB requirements which are defined in national regulation implementing the EPBD and are mandatory for all new buildings across EU Member States from 2021 To be eligible the net primary energy demand of the new construction must be at least 20 lower than the primary energy demand resulting from the relevant NZEB requirements418 This reduction can be met through a direct decrease of the
1297,418 The PED is either directly expressed by NZEB requirements or is derived by applying those requirements and calculating the resulting PED When NZEB requirements specify a PED the percentage improvement should be applied to this figure
1298,primary energy demand via a more efficient design or by offsetting with onsite and offsite renewable generation or a combination of both strategies Offsite energy generation must be limited to district heating and cooling systems and local renewable energy sources 419
1299,The establishment of a relative threshold in the form of a percentage improvement on NZEB requirements is justified by the fact that from 2021 new constructions will be mandated by nationalregional building regulations to comply with NZEB requirements This implies that the taxonomy must require better levels of performance than NZEB or all new constructions would be automatically eligible which would fail to direct finance towards more sustainable solutions and run the risk of diverting finance from the renovation of existing buildings Since NZEB requirements correspond to different levels of performance across EU Member States  the use of a percentage improvement rather than absolute figures allows a degree of proportionality to be applied in Member States where NZEB requirements result in a comparatively low PED the energy reduction necessary to achieve the 20 improvement is smaller than in Member States where NZEB requirements result in a comparatively high primary energy demand
1300,Inappropriate building location impacts on ecosystems if built on greenfield and especially if in a conservation area or high biodiversity value area Indirect damage to forest ecosystems due to the use of timber products originating form forests that are not sustainably managed
1301,At least 80 by weight of the nonhazardous construction and demolition waste excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list422 generated on the construction site must be prepared for reuse or sent for recycling or other material recovery including backfilling operations that use waste to substitute other materials423
1302,5b  If the new construction is located on a potentially contaminated site brownfield site the site must be subject to an investigation for potential contaminants for example using standard BS 10175425
1303,6a  The new construction must not be built on protected natural areas such as land designated as Natura 2000 UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas KBAs or equivalent outside the EU as defined by UNESCO and  or the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN under the following categories
1304,421 httpwwweuropeanwaterlabeleu Outside the EU relevant water appliances will need to meet the flow rates identified by the EU Water Label as threshold for the top 2 classes of water consumption Details on flow rates and testing method httpwwweuropeanwaterlabeleupdfschememarch2019enpdf
1305,6c  At least 80 of all timber products used in the new construction for structures cladding and finishes426 must have been either recycledreused or sourced from sustainably managed forests as certified by thirdparty certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies eg FSCPEFC standards or equivalent427
1306,426 These products are categorised as follows according to the Combined Nomenclature set out in Annex I to Council Regulation EEC No 265887 4407 Wood sawn or chipped lengthwise sliced or peeled whether or not planed sanded or endjointed of a thickness exceeding 6 mm 4408 Sheets for veneering including those obtained by slicing laminated wood for plywood or for other similar laminated wood and other wood sawn lengthwise sliced or peeled whether or not planed sanded spliced or endjointed of a thickness not exceeding 6 mm 4409 Wood including strips and friezes for parquet flooring not assembled continuously shaped tongued grooved rebated chamfered Vjointed beaded moulded rounded or the like along any of its edges ends or faces whether or not planed sanded or endjointed 4410 Particle board oriented strand board OSB and similar board for example waferboard of wood or other ligneous materials whether or not agglomerated with resins or other organic binding substances 4411 Fibreboard of wood or other ligneous materials whether or not bonded with resins or other organic substances 4412 Plywood veneered panels and similar laminated wood 4413 00 00 Densified wood in blocks plates strips or profile shapes 4418 Builders joinery and carpentry of wood including cellular wood panels assembled flooring panels shingles and shakes 9406 00 20 Prefabricated buildings
1307,The renovation of existing buildings to improve their energy performance makes a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation by reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions for the remaining operational phase of the buildings and by avoiding emissions that would be associated with the construction of new buildings
1308,Condition for noneligibility to avoid lockin and undermining the climate mitigation objective the renovation of buildings occupied for the purpose of extraction storage transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels is not eligible
1309,Use of alternative schemes as proxies outside EU Member States established schemes such as green building certifications or building regulations and standards may be used as alternative proof of eligibility provided that this is verified by the Sustainable Finance Platform The organisation responsible for the scheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting evidence that a specific level of certificationregulation can be considered equivalent or superior to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold for the relevant climatic zone and building type The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application
1310,The thresholds used to assess the renovation rely on either the respective metrics set in the applicable building energy performance regulation for major renovation transposing the EPBD or in the case of relative improvement on Primary Energy Demand PED defined as follows the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building lifecycle ie module B6 according to EN15978 calculated exante according to the national methodologies for asset design assessment or as defined in the set of standards ISO 52000 expressed as kWhm2 per year
1311,set in the applicable building regulations for major renovation transposing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive EPBD The energy performance of the building or the renovated part upgraded must meet costoptimal minimum energy performance requirements in accordance with the EPBD
1312,Energy Demand of at least 30 in comparison to the energy performance of the building before the renovation429 The initial energy performance and the estimated improvement shall be based on a specialised building survey and validated by an Energy Performance Certificate an energy audit conducted by an accredited independent expert or any other transparent and proportionate method
1313,The choice of a threshold based on the minimum energy performance requirements to be met by buildings undergoing major renovation is strongly affected by the necessity of substantially increasing the annual rates of renovations that include energyefficiency measures Such requirements are established in EU Member States at national or regional level in building regulations implementing the EPBD and are based on calculations of costoptimality Access to advantageous financing conditions is meant to incentivise homeowners and businesses to undertake a renovation that includes energy efficiency measures
1314,The threshold for relative improvement is given as alternative to allow the eligibility of renovations that may not meet the major renovation requirements but still deliver considerable energy savings as well as to provide a threshold that is easily applicable outside EU Member States
1315,Since the focus of the criteria is the renovation project and not the building in itself any renovation can be eligible independently from the absolute performance of the building as long as it meets either one of the two thresholds
1316,a the total cost of the renovation relating to the building envelope or the technical building systems is higher than 25  of the value of the building excluding the value of the land upon which the building is situated or
1317,429 The 30 improvement must result from an actual reduction in primary energy demand ie reductions in net primary energy demand through renewable energy sources do not count and can be achieved through a succession of measures within a maximum of 3 years
1318,All relevant new water appliances shower solutions mixer showers shower outlets taps WC suites WC bowls and flushing cisterns urinal bowls and flushing cisterns bathtubs must be in the top 2 classes for water consumption of the EU Water Label431
1319,At least 80 by weight of the nonhazardous construction and demolition waste excluding naturally occurring material defined in category 17 05 04 in the EU waste list432 generated on the construction site must be prepared for reuse or sent for recycling or other material recovery including backfilling operations that use waste to substitute other materials433
1320,5b  Before starting the renovation work a building survey must be carried out in accordance with national legislation by a competent specialist with training in asbestos surveying and in identification of other materials containing substances
1321,431 httpwwweuropeanwaterlabeleu Outside the EU relevant water appliances will need to meet the flow rates identified by the EU Water Label as threshold for the top 2 classes of water consumption Details on flow rates and testing method httpwwweuropeanwaterlabeleupdfschememarch2019enpdf
1322,of concern Any stripping of lagging that contains or is likely to contain asbestos breaking or mechanical drilling or screwing andor removal of insulation board tiles and other asbestos containing materials shall be carried out by appropriately trained personnel with health monitoring before during and after the works in accordance with national legislation
1323,At least 80 of all timber products used in the renovation for structures cladding and finishes must have been either recycledreused or sourced from sustainably managed forests as certified by thirdparty certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies eg FSCPEFC standards or equivalent435
1324,Individual measures make a contribution to climate change mitigation by reducing energy use and carbon emissions for the operational phase of the building Professional services are a necessary support and validation mechanism especially for building renovation The investment linked to the individual measures must be aimed at improving energy performance andor reduction of carbon emissions The motivation can be demonstrated through an energy audit an Energy Performance Certificate EPC or any other transparent and proportionate method acceptable by the Sustainable Finance Platform
1325,The following individual measures are eligible if compliant with minimum requirements set for individual components and systems in the applicable national regulations transposing the Energy Performance Building Directive EPBD and must meet Ecodesign requirements pursuant to Directive 2009125EC
1326,external walls roofs including green roofs lofts basements and ground floors including measures to ensure airtightness measures to reduce the effects of thermal bridges and scaffolding and products for the application of the insulation to the building envelope mechanical fixings adhesive etc
1327,Requirements for individual measures a to e are based on costoptimal measures defined in the applicable regulation transposing the revised EPBD As such they represent feasible levels of improvements within the local context taking into consideration climate building stock and market conditions However the TEG recognises that these requirements have been determined differently by each Member State and therefore do not necessarily represent a consistent level of ambition across countries
1328,Professional activities v and w are eligible as they are necessary for the appropriate assessment of building conditions and potential for energy efficiency Professional activities x to z are eligible as they can help deliver energy savings through efficient building operations
1329,5b  In case of addition of thermal insulation to the existing building envelope a building survey must be carried out in accordance with national legislation by a competent specialist with training in asbestos surveying and in identification of other materials containing substances of concern Any stripping of lagging that contains or is likely to contain asbestos breaking or mechanical drilling or screwing andor removal of insulation board tiles and other asbestos containing materials shall be carried out by appropriately trained personnel with health monitoring before during and after the works in accordance with national legislation
1330,The acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle instead of lowerperforming ones can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives While specific data on embodied carbon and thus carbon emissions from the full lifecycle is still limited and needs to be further generated the acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions during the use phase can already make an important contribution by directing users towards highperforming properties and by sending signals to markets about the need to lift the overall energy performance of the whole stock
1331,For large nonresidential buildings ie buildings with an effective rated output for heating systems or systems for combined space heating and ventilation of over 290 kW or buildings with floor area437 over 1000 m2 an additional requirement is introduced to ensure that these buildings are operated efficiently and that actual energy and carbon savings are delivered each year
1332,Condition for noneligibility to avoid lockin and undermining the climate mitigation objective the acquisition and ownership of buildings for the purpose of extraction storage transportation or manufacture of fossil fuels are not eligible
1333,Use of alternative schemes as proxies outside EU Member States established schemes such as green building certifications or building regulations may be used as alternative proof of eligibility provided that this is verified by the Sustainable Finance Platform The organisation responsible for the scheme will be able to apply for official recognition of its scheme by presenting evidence that a specific level of certificationregulation can be considered equivalent or superior to the taxonomy mitigation and DNSH threshold established for the relevant climatic zone and building type The Sustainable Finance Platform will assess the evidence and approve or reject the application
1334,The metric is Primary Energy Demand PED the annual primary energy demand associated with regulated energy use during the operational phase of the building lifecycle ie module B6 according to EN15978 calculated exante according to
1335,Alignment with this criterion can be demonstrated by providing adequate evidence comparing the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the local stock built before 31 December 2020 Such evidence should be based on a representative sample of the building stock in the respective area where the building is located distinguishing at the very least between residential and non residential buildings The area can be defined as a city a region or a country
1336,Certification schemes such as EPCs may be used as evidence of eligibility when adequate data is available to demonstrate that a specific level eg EPC A clearly falls within the top 15 of the respective local stock
1337,The TEG recognises that more work needs to be done to collect and analyse data in order to define absolute thresholds corresponding to the performance of the top 15 of each local stock such as data showing the distribution of EPCs across the stock and the thresholds used to define EPC ratings
1338,The acquisition of buildings designed to minimise energy use and carbon emissions throughout the lifecycle instead of lowerperforming ones can make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation objectives by
1339,creating demand for such buildings this in turn will stimulate owners to build and renovate buildings to a higher level of performance than they would have done otherwise sending a clear signal to the market that the acquisition of such buildings against an ever more stringent legislative background and changing client preferences can help reduce future potential risk and value depreciation
1340,approach in each local stock Rather than attempting to establish absolute thresholds with an incomplete set of data for the time being the TEG opted for a threshold based on a percentage of the stock which ensures a levelplaying field across different Member States For now the corresponding 15 was deemed an appropriate level for the best in class performance finding a compromise between the need to establish high standards of performance while recognising the need to maintain and create opportunity in the existing market
1341,Excessive water consumption due to inefficient water appliances  Presence of asbestos andor substances of very high concern in the building materials  Presence of hazardous contaminants in the soil of the building site
1342,6a  The building must not be built on protected natural areas such as land designated as Natura 2000 UNESCO World Heritage and Key Biodiversity Areas KBAs or equivalent outside the EU as defined by UNESCO and  or the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN under the following categories
1343,6b  The building must not be built on arable or greenfield land of recognised high biodiversity value and land that serves as habitat of endangered species flora and fauna listed on the European Red List and  or the IUCN Red List
1344,The technical screening criteria for substantial contribution to climate change adaptation are restated here for convenience They differentiate between adapted activities and activities enabling adaptation For further discussion of these concepts please see Substantial contribution to Climate change adaptation
1345,A11 The economic activity integrates physical and nonphysical measures aimed at reducing  to the extent possible and on a best effort basis  all material physical climate risks to that activity which have been identified through a risk assessment
1346,The economic activity reduces material physical climate risk in other economic activities andor addresses systemic barriers to adaptation Activities enabling adaptation include but are not limited to activities that
1347,Some extra information is provided throughout this report for the economic activities in the taxonomy and activities which should be included in future subject to full DNSH assessment These examples were selected on the basis of the following characteristics
1348,Not all of the activities selected are included in the Taxonomy at this stage subject to further technical work In particular two activities Research and development natural sciences and engineering and Provision of specialised telecommunications applications for weather monitoring and forecast are considered to have the potential to make a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation and therefore a full evaluation of their environmental impacts should be prioritised
1349,This additional information covers the typical climaterelated hazards that those activities tend to be sensitive to and adaptation measures that may be taken to address those sensitivities This is based on experience drawn from industry practice and existing sensitivity matrices used by development finance institutions This additional information is provided simply as a starting point by users to assist in identifying physical climate risks to an activity and measures to address those risks But it does not take the place of a context specific risk assessment given that relevant climaterelated hazards and required adaptation measures will be location and context specific and will be identified through the application of the qualitative screening criteria described below
1350,Afforestation is defined as the establishment of forest through planting andor deliberate seeding on land that until then was under a different land use implies a transformation of land use from nonforest to forest442
1351,Forests are an unusual economic sector in which they provide a substantial carbon sink and that significant harm for forest climate change mitigation include where an adaptation activity leads to a significant longterm reduction of the carbon sink It is therefore important to maintain the forest area and thus forest carbon stocks and sink potential over the longterm The principles for ensuring mitigation proofed adaptation activities are that adaptation responses should
1352,Article 297b of the recast Renewable Energy Directive EU20182001 which determines the requirement for management systems to be in place at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term
1353,Identify and manage risks related to water quality andor water consumption at the appropriate level Ensure that water useconservation management plans developed in consultation with relevant stakeholders have been developed and implemented
1354,techniques such as nonchemical alternatives to pesticides in line with the Directive 2009128EC on the sustainable use of pesticides With exception of occasions that this is needed to control pest and diseases outbreaks Adapt the use of fertilizers to what is needed to prevent leeching of nutrients to waters
1355,ingredients that are listed in the Stockholm Convention the Rotterdam Convention the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer or that are listed as classification Ia or Ib in the WHO recommended Classification of Pesticides by Hazard

1734,Nonlife insurance eligible for the Taxonomy includes selected LOBs and insurance products and services that provide cover for climaterelated hazards to activities andor assets that are Taxonomy aligned
1735,As the number and range of subsectors eligible for the Taxonomy evolves arising from development of substantial contribution to the remaining four environmental objectives additional activities will become eligible for Taxonomy aligned nonlife insurance products Furthermore the TEG believes that economic activities that may not be screened for substantial contribution to any of the six environmental objectives such as environmentally neutral activities schools hospitals public administration services etc which may nonetheless be impacted by climate change should be considered as potentially eligible for Taxonomy aligned nonlife insurance TEG recommends further consideration of DNSH criteria for nonlife insurance activities to enhance the coverage of activities and improve usability of the criteria
